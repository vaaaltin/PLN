The expert suggests creating, alternatively, the Comissão_Interministerial to Combat Drug pa in direct dependence on the Conselho_de_Ministros. 
in the document that was the vehicle of the proposal - and that the express had access - If argues: 
Experience has shown that systematic delegation in the Ministério_da_Justiça or the health prevented that coordination had any efficacy when dependent services of so many ministries are involved in the matter. 
The existence of multiple services with the same vocation has given the subordination and the inoperability of the Cabinet. 
The development of the Projecto_Vida - action that includes, for the first time, all the valences of the problem - established a discouragement that had deep roots: 
to the astonishment of the technicians of the Cabinet, coordination was not entrusted to them, and the Government decided to explicitly name the licensed Ana_Marques_Vicente (adjunct Leonor_Beleza) to the coordinator of the action. 
A short time later, already in January this year, a joint order - then seen as the death knell of the Cabinet - clarifies the creation of a Grupo_Operacional_de_Coordenação of the various services, bodies and agencies involved in combating trafficking. 
However, not only the decision has not been applied as new perplexity joined him, 
Ana_Marques_Vicente the powers have been strengthened, with its elevation president aa category of a Grupo_Coordenador of the Projecto_Vida. 
It was created a new parallelism in the public_administration. 
The Office - now conclude experts, requesting anonymity for fear of disciplinary proceedings - makes walking but never walks, esbracejando to stay in an existence that is after all fictitious. 
All things considered, a critical (aa articulated in form of a big question mark) appears grangear consensus: 
When will there be the courage to recognize that the fight aa drug has to be addressed at the highest level in dependence on the prime minister, and that the Office should be abolished? .
Cocaine seizures - which totaled some 46 kilograms in1983 mais_de - grew a lot in the past few years, reaching more than 222 kilograms in 1987, and the visible side is no more than the tip of a gigantic iceberg. 
Statistical analysis - that the express had access - proves that almost 70 percent of the drug is coming from countries of the South_America with Colombia and Brazil aa head. 
The development, at all levels of relations between Portugal and Brazil largely explains - in the opinion of the technical - the increase in traffic: 
the facilities, the greater cada_vez in the back and forth to Brazil, the common language and the great exchange the artistic level are a appointed as significant factor. 
And the dismantling, this week, of cocaine trafficking network that operated between Manaus and Braga has given more credibility to the alert to the Brazilian danger. 
The arrest of the traffickers was possible a_partir_de statements produced by two Brazilians, already held, who acted as couriers of the organization between Brazil and Portugal, having -If also been learned that the Godfather of the organization is José_de_Almeida_Magalhães, an industrial Braga based in Manaus, and his deputy, a lieutenant of the Brazilian army. 
In 1986, Angola was the second largest exporter of cocaine detected for Portugal, and if it is not a producer country, ensure that judges act as entreposto_da drugs in transit. 
These data, and many more remain, however, fallow in the files of the Office of Planning and Coordination of the Fight Drug aa constituting clues that should be explored. 
A consequent action would require the assistance of various ministries - observe the technicians who criticize Polícia_Judiciária not treat conveniently these issues and complain that they have never been serious warnings made Colombian officials: 
These data - ajuizam - should be communicated to foreign entities, serving argument for the establishment of agreements and conventions. 
heroin seizures also increased almost 6 kilograms in 1983 to 30 in 1987 cerca_de. 
India and Mexico (whose heroine has different characteristics of the Indian) emerged at the top of last year as countries of origin, o_que shows - according to experts - the great vulnerability of Portugal. 
True free market, Portugal seems to receive heroin everywhere: 
in 1986, the main seizures originated in Nigeria, in Pakistan and Thailand, emerging, such as traffic scales, countries such as the Netherlands, Switzerland and Spain. 
There seems to be - observed a technical - throw open a border, for the different origins and influences of heroin. 
A pair of heroin and cocaine, also begins to emerge, in increasing amounts, an exquisite product: 
The hash oil prepared a_partir_da resin and whose transportation facility stimulates their proliferation. 
Source connected to the dealers told the Express that its consumption is being promoted in the streets of Lisbon through offers on a trial basis: 
An individual who put one drop of oil on a cigarette immediately experiences a much larger active ingredient do_que which results in a simple joint. 
This drug has invaded the barracks themselves where the problem takes much more delicate aspects. 
With the institutionalization of the European single market in 1992 will fall the boundaries between the twelve member countries of the EEC, allowing themselves to free movement of people and goods. 
Strangely, however, no preventive measure was also enacted in Portugal. 
The situation is worrying: 
while the number of dependent heroin proven increases - from 201 in 1983 to 582 in 1987 - the number of traffickers arrested by the different police decreased from 215 in 1986 to 193 in the last year. 
in the last five years they have officially requested treatment in 2409 dependent on heroin and cocaine 16; 
however, it is estimated there are in Portugal from 10 to 30 thousand addicts. 
The margin of variation of this estimate - truly amazing - highlights another of the Portuguese weaknesses: 
statistics. 
Even the director of the Office, the Joaquim_Rodrigues psychologist, had to admit recently in the course of a conference in the Instituto_de_Defesa_Nacional, the indicators that the Cabinet does not produce mais_que cover 10 to 30 percent of reality. 
The only centrally collected data are those relating aa repression of the offer, provided by all police aa PJ, whose maps show have been held in the past three years, 558 traffickers of heroin and 249 of cocaine. 
in the respect aa containment demand, centralizing back to fail, and the fighting, although well-intentioned, proceeds disorganized way. 
Are not realized, por_exemplo, scientific studies able to establish the relationship between the price and purity of the product, nor shall aa chemical analysis of the products seized in the street, o_que would determine the source of the heroin circulating in the market illicit Portuguese. 
Cavaco_Silva came to recognize - in the course of his visit this week to Centro_das_Taipas in Lisbon - the need to intensify the fight aa drug. 
principle declarations continue, however, with very little practice match. nan nan SÃ ​​?? O_PAULO - The state of SÃ £ o_Paulo again suffered with attacks on police stations, agÃªncias bancÃ¡rias and Ã'nibus in the early hours of Monday.

Work in the most famous stadium in the country with the Brazilian shirt was new to most of the athletes. 
of the 22 summoned by Dunga, Ronaldinho had only played at the Maracana with the selection. 
It was also a long time that the selection does not disputed a match in Brazil. 
The last game was in October 2005 in a 3-0 victory over Venezuela in Bethlehem, even for the qualifying tournament for the World Germany. 
in the match against Ecuador, the team led by coach Dunga also needed to erase the image left after the goalless draw with Colombia in Bogota, in the debut in the qualifiers. 
for the first time, Brazil was superior. 
The team played the ball in the midfield, but did not attack with danger. 
at the moment some boos were heard in the Maracanã, the team started to play better. 
After a fumbling Ecuadorian defender, the slight Vágner_Love striker took the ball and kicked the beam in the 15min. 
Before long, Love hit the target. 
to the 19min, Maicon plucked by the right side of the attack and crossed. 
marking-free, the attacker --after six games without scoring goals by the staff-- touched the ball into the back of the nets and broke the fast. 
Even with the goal, Brazil failed to shine. 
Robinho, Ronaldinho and Kaka struggled, but did not create many moves. 
in the final step, the Ecuadorian coach Tenorio put the striker in the place of the Quiróz midfielder. 
The replacement became the most offensive team, but the Brazilian half had more space to create. 
to the 12 minutes, a free kick, Ecuador almost leveled the match. 
Castillo hit hard, but the ball went por_cima_do the goal. 
Seven minutes later, Brazil responded. 
Love received another cross from Maicon, but headed out.

The ball deflected off Ronaldinho and past the keeper. 
to the 32min, Kaka tried again. 
From outside the area, he kicked. 
of this time, the ball did not turn anyone and entered into the angle. 
Even with Dunga's decision to leave for the Love Elano midfielder, the team has not lost offensive power. 
Robinho pedaled, dribbled the defender and kicked into the middle of the area. 
on the rebound, Elano made the fourth goal in the 38min. 
Again, Kaka scored from outside the area. 
The ball was weak, but the keeper Daniel_Viteri failed. 
After the chicken, Kaka smiled and hardly celebrated the 40min.

The proposal provides for exemption of CPMF for employees earning up to R $ 4,340 monthly. 
The PSDB, however, considered insufficient. 
the end of the meeting, the PSDB senators said they expect the government to submit a counter-proposal in the next few hours. 
Let's do a comprehensive review (of the proposal). 
This is clearly not enough to convince the PSDB, said the leader of the party in the Senate, Arthur_Virgílio (AM). 
The initial proposal for the government provided exemption for wages of up to R $ 1,640 per month. 
Mantega said the toucans that the measures presented today represent an exemption of R $ 4 billion in the next year and come to five in 2009. 
of this total, R $ 2.68 billion would only CPMF. 
For Virgil, the government can still move forward in the proposal. 
We feel that they still have a limit of fat to burn. 
. 
He argues that the government walk in the direction of reducing public spending and the tax burden. 
Toucans now expect an improvement of the proposal of the government. 
What was made today will be brought to the knowledge of the counter. 
We want you to do more or the government will have to agree with the dissenting opinion, threatened the Senator. 
According to the national president of the legend, Senator Tasso_Jereissati (EC), the PSDB postponed the meeting scheduled for today aa night, because the proposal would be very complex and needs to be studied. 
The proposal of the government does not move in the pocket it. 
Just change in cash flow, he said the proposed tax relief for businesses. 
The PEC extending the collection of the CPMF is moving in the Senate, where it needs 49 votes to pass. 
Today's proposal gives full exemption for wages up to R $ 4,340. 
Acima_desse this value, the exemption is limited partial to R $ 214 in the year. 
For an income of up to R $ 1,640, compensation would be made through the contribution to the INSS (Instituto_Nacional of the Seguro_Social). 
Acima_desse this amount and up to R $ 4,340, the worker would have a sort of bonus on the declaration of the Imposto_de_Renda that will cause it to receive a larger refund or pay less taxes. 
The value is limited to R $ 214, which is equivalent to a tax check the incident on a salary of $ 4,340 for the period of one year (including the 13th salary). 
Who wins more than R $ 4,340 also in the proposal of the government, you can use this rebate, but limited to R $ 214. 
Another novelty is that the government has proposed is to limit the growth of current expenditure by 2.5% per year after inflation --já. 
The bill that is in the Congresso_Nacional has just limit for spending on the salaries of the servers. 
Mantega also maintained other measures already announced in the meeting with the toucans in the past week:

anticipate the PIS-Cofins credit levied on exports from 24 months to 18 months; 
and reduce by half the period of depreciation of capital goods and real estate, which is a rebate that companies make in the social contribution (Contribuição_Social on Lucro_Líquido) on investments made.

The match started very tied. 
Ecuadorians marked very strong and did not give any space for Brazil, who played the ball without much objectivity. 
Soon the mood of the crowd began to run out, and the first boos echoed through the packed Maracana, when the 18 minutes, Maicon shot by the right and crossed a ground ball that Vágner_Love knock the basket goal:

An irony, by the way, because before the game, while on the screen appeared the players of the national team, Vágner had brought a loud boo. 
It's great to have had a goal diante_dessa this wonderful crowd. 
My family is all here, said one Vágner_Love excited. 
And the first time was in it, in the expectation that Brazil could finally show his best football in the final stage.

the 26 minutes the crowd cursed and asked Obina in the selection, when Kaka scored from far and Ronaldinho_Gaúcho gave a slight offset in the ball, deceiving the Ecuadorian goalkeeper. 
A_partir_daí then he turned party. 
The Brazil broke free and started the show. 
Kaka hit a beautiful shot away from the angle in the 31 and made 3-0. 
And six minutes later, a real painting move. 
Robinho, who just appeared in the match, took the ball to the bottom line and made all sorts of dribbles on the defenders astonished to Ecuador, crossed to dentro_da small area and Elano - Wed had just walked into the place of Vágner_Love - only added to the back of the net. 
When the crowd was singing and shouting olé, Kaka still wanted to do more, only the fifth Brazilian goal was much merit of the Viteri archer, who did not hold a weak kick and in the middle of the goal given by the half Brazilian. nan nan Government increased to 4,340 reais a salary cap that poderÃ¡ be exempted from the payment of the CPMF, in a esforÃ§o to convince the PSDB to vote in favor of the £ prorrogaÃ§Ã the tribute ATA © 2011.

Nothing looks better match this Jaspers response that everything has long been condensed in books, collections and libraries, dealing with what is and what is human and, by extension, humanity. 
The most important cultural phenomenon of our time is certainly revealed the inability of Western culture to understand the man and predict their behavior. 
Except a few voices, rather reduced prophetic thinkers and situated within walking distance of us, a Burkhardt, one Nietzsche, por_exemplo, no, a century ago, seemed to be able to predict the disastrous course that Western civilization would walk by dragging with it the destiny of all humanity and threatening the very extinction of life on the planet. 
Also in the thirties, there are only fifty years ago, some thinkers amazed the audience with cultivated sociological references and suggestions for - historizantes called pessimistic: 
Ingenieros, Jaspers, Gasset, on the one hand, Aldous_Huxley Orwell and the other, called attention to unreleased psycho-sociological demonstrations or the possibility of the construction of entire societies that fit into the framework of the collective or social pathology. 
And short years, all these findings and predictions found themselves overtaken by the facts, having become -If patent that social life had come to be subject to a fatalism that seemed out aa willingness to men and drove them to monstrous patterns existence. 
Doubts have been resolved quanto_ao the pathological nature of Western society. 
Furthermore, we ask -In today this disease process should not extend -If aa nature of the own social phenomenon become noticeable due to gigantism that was printed by him overpopulation associated with technical progress. 
Koestler in 1969, raises the possibility of human society, from its origin, a reality whose typical manifestations are clearly pathological (aa light of the rules of life), while Diawara black sociologist puts in the post company - neolithic the beginning of this disease process. 
The social man have always been (ie as soon as the primitive society gave aa civilized society) a being sickly and sentenced aa vital degeneration, o_que, a_longo_prazo, could mean their condemnation without appeal as a way of life? 
This question, explicitly or implicitly called, led to an intense, we would say frantic search for explanations and justifications. 
It was thus left to the equivocal position that man should not obey aa nature, but beat -la to another much more humble and as the consequences: 
try to see where was the mistake made by the human species, which led to a social existence that pointed directly to the collective suicide. 
The uncomfortable feeling that humanity came treading a divergent path of natural designs outside perceived by many thinkers, fitting Francisco_Bacon the inestimable merit of having given the warning cry, to have advised humanity to try to win the Nature obeying HIM . 
in the however, by a phenomenon that only a historical psychoanalysis could explain, took ascendency, for centuries, the opposite position, that the fate of humanity was to challenge and win the Nature opposing it. 
This form of man show that was no longer the animal and could build its own order, parallel or even divergent of the natural order, fed psychic frenzy that took hold of Western civilization, converting it into a kind of athlete who demand exceeds increasingly themselves in the execution of their antics, seduced by the incitement of the public. 
All this to aa 2ª_Guerra_Mundial or mais_concretamente, until 1945. 
in this moment, not only a few visionaries distant, nem_sequer a number of astute thinkers or warned sociologists recognized the bankruptcy of the theories of man and society which called for a confrontation with nature in the search for an original destination and discontinuous with the other life forms; 
a collective sense of fear and horror, a kind of collective unconscious of survival, did -If feel, asking new explanations and a unique understanding of the human problem. 
There were several routes that culture undertook corresponding HIM bestsellers and having -If widespread discussions that had already had its beginnings in the years prior to World War. 
Biologists clearly put the dangers arising from genetic defects that suffered the current humanity. 
Muller_Morgan and many others spoke of the reduction of the genetic quality due to the population increase of the action of modern medicine in the biological selection and the negative consequences of the economic and social environment in the improvement of human biology. 
Ethologists with Lorenz aa front pored If threatening about some social phenomena such as aggression and parasitism, having studied in the other community life, fish, birds and mammals. 
Find the distinction of what is natural or not, in the social man and life in society, by comparison and analogy with o_que goes into every other species did -In dive into a fascinating novel in which the Nature showed exceed imagination of all teachers of literature ... 
Had the merit, these works reveal that many of the social and psychological manifestations that were considered unique to humans and fruits of their emancipation against other forms of life were still sophisticated forms of behavior born of remaining instincts and tendencies of his animal existence. 
Por_fim came an important article on the anthropoids and ethnologists. 
The earliest studies on apes and primate societies, which had merit precursors in Kohler, Zukermann, Yerkes, found in modern works of Terrace, Miss_Patterson, Premack, the couple Cardner, among others, due continuity and led to surprising conclusions about the individual and collective psychology of our closest relatives in animal scale. 
Similarly, the Desmond_Morris books like Macaco_Nu and Zoo_Humano, establish an approach somewhat demoralizing between the friendly animals that visited in the cages of zoos and humans winners of gravity and protagonists of the amazing space adventure. 
How far after separating out the middle man of the chimpanzee Nim, of the Washoe chimpanzee or its sister Sara? 
That subtle fluid distinguishes the average Canadian voter or Luxembourgish Koko, the gorilla who managed to M. Patterson with evangelical patience, teach mais_de 400 signs and symbols? 
Serge_Moscovici by putting head on the question of the civilized man, living in an unnatural society, it is a domestic animal that has lost over the domestication process the quality of being free, puts a full issue of suggestions and even confrontations ethical. 
However, it is still in the study of primitive societies and the interpretation of its rules of individual and collective psychology, in its comparison with historical and contemporary societies, we can find more reflective matter. 
The lower animals, primates and primitive man constitute an evolutionary line that always proves more complex, until ending in the qualitative leap that is civilization. 
And then it looks like an inexplicable event, a blessing or a curse, but certainly an adulteration of the natural rules, pushed the man to an original route with unknown purposes that modern technology began to terrifying contours. 
longer be primitive man a being unnatural, ie in a purely naturalistic view, a patient? 
It would have been with the missing link that started the irreversible march towards social and individual pathology? 
The Diawara sociologist argues that the longevity and stability of primitive societies justify their sanity, though not deny the originality front aa remaining natural life before by otherwise. 
Primitive man would then be the first, and after all the only real man understood as creative element of a future society sui generis and truly human. 
Among primitive humans, physically deformed and dragging a semianimalesca experience, showing the magazines and newspapers, and civilized human beings delivered to the hands of a consumer society, it will be difficult to choose in terms of human quality or even existential justification . 
Por_outro_lado, the historical study of empires and civilizations convinces -In that only small crop circles the man revealed that spiritual soul that today seem to be enough to justify, summarize or acquit (as yet intended, with charming naivete, the elder Bertrand_Russell ) our old and misleading mankind. 
The study of primitive societies (of which there are absent or violence or cruelty, or other deadly sins of the species, which Koestler pointed out) brings only -In the revelation that they had no place in psychiatrists but in all is the sorcerer (collective psychiatrist or Moreno then) and, worse than that, the sum of pacifying that Aldous_Huxley spoken in your Admirável_Mundo_Novo. 
This evil of the century, as he called it Hans_Selve, stress is a disease that already existed in primitive societies, which exists today and that Huxley foresaw exist in your world mechanized and artificial, dominated by a genetic technology that afeiçoava the human body the social tasks. 
But this stress that is ultimately the result of an inability to adapt man to the civilizational environment will not mean its condemnation as a living being? 
Your epidemic character and the fact that you have reached the nerve centers and the very basis of psychological life, can not mean that nature has decided it starts to not be able to continue living as a car that begins to slow for lack of fuel? 
Attempts to modern response in the fight against stress: 
the picanálise, yoga, transcendental meditation (or feature aa religion, recklessly disparaged by free-thinkers of the eighteenth century) does not seem to be sufficient, nem_mesmo supported by the chemical technology, barbiturates, relaxing or beta inhibitors. 
The win on stress, fear, anxiety and tannates aa expense of subjecting the personal and social behavior pharmacological control raises however moral problems and puts the very front question of the difference there may be between a living being drugged and a robot activated by electronic amphetamines.
This leads us to understand much better now that statement apparently controversial of the old Jung, made during an interview shortly before his death, ie that the great man is one who is more aware of your monkey condition .. . nan nan President of the Chamber, Arlindo_Chinaglia (PT-SP), scored for today's vote the PEC (Proposta_de_Emenda_Constitucional) extending the collection of the CPMF (Contribuição_Provisória on Movimentação_Financeira) by 2011 and maintaining the rate of 0.38% .

After the independence of Tunisia in 1956, it was carried out a major campaign to reduce the dowry to a symbolic sum and the beginning of the 1960s the djerbanos married themselves with a symbolic dowry of a dinar. 
After the hejba, future married ceases to leave your home for a while (a week to a month), mainly to protect from the sun, because the white skin is one of the main criteria of beauty in Djerba, as in Tunisia in general.

Big East are federations or confederations in the least three Masonic Lodges that initially did not work in the same Masonic rite, as they were required by the Grande_Lojas. 
Masonry (reduced and usual form of Freemasonry) is a secret society of universal character, whose members cultivate aclassismo, humanity, the principles of freedom, democracy and equality, fraternity and intellectual improvement, thus an initiatory and philosophical association. 
If Masons structure and gather themselves in autonomous cells, called workshops, workshops or (as they are more correctly known and designated) Shops, all equal in rights and honors, and independent. .
Grande_Oriente of o Brazil (GOB) is the oldest Brazilian Potência_Maçônica (Association Lojas_Maçônicas, also called Obediência_Maçônica). 
The GOB has participated actively in crucial moments of the Brazilian history, such as the abolition of slavery and the proclamation of the Republic. 
Bahia was the birthplace of Freemasonry in Brazil, as it was the birthplace of the discovery. 
in the beginning of the Século_XX established constitutional norms Masonic for the creation and installation of the Grandes_Orientes_Estaduais, was to be expected and even imperative that Bahia and was the eldest of the Masonic activities of Brazil, was also one of the first states to have their Unidade_Federativa next to Grande_Oriente of Brazil. 
Some chronic and articles of researchers realize that the first Loja_Maçônica of Bahia and Brazil was the Cavaleiros_da_Luz, founded in 1797, in a French frigate he was anchored in the village of Barra in Salvador, in 1802, was founded the store? Virtue and Reason, resulting in 1813 aa Loja_União and Loja_Humanidade. 
When Marechal_Deodoro of Fonseca resigned from the Grand Master, the December 18, 1891, it was replaced by the Deputy, Antônio_Joaquim_de_Macedo_Soares minister. 
And during the interim period this was promulgated the 1892 Constitution, which, among other things, provided for the creation of state Grandes_Lojas federated to the GOB (Grande_Oriente for Brazil). 
The title Great store was therefore introduced in Brazil for the GOB to designate state Obediences federated. 
And the first two state Grandes_Lojas federated to GOB were the São_Paulo and Bahia, created, respectively, to May 14, 1892 and March 7, 1892. 
The Grande_Loja of the State of Bahia was installed May 14, 1893 and would be extinguished August 6, 1900, diante_da dissent of Bahian Shops, that the March 7, 1900, had founded one Grande_Oriente_Autônomo spurious of the Bahia, separating If the GOB. 
Bahia was therefore one of the first states? in reality, the first, chronologically?
Obedience to have its federated However an unfortunate fact, in terms no_que aa Masonic unit erupted in 1927 in the bosom of the Maçonaria_Brasileira, reaching in full to all the federal units and, more forcefully, Bahia. 
If it comes from the infamous Schism that caused the explosion of Freemasonry of Brazil, dividing it into several Powers, some of them without the devido_reconhecimento. 
Other however, they won forum and lasted to the present day. 
This schism has caused grave consequences for Maçonaria_Brasileira. 
Bahia however, was the state most affected because only a few remaining shops - menos_de a dozen - the jurisdictional Grande_Oriente of Brazil, considering that after the publication of the Manifesto_do_Soberano_Supremo_Conselho, on December 15, 1927. 
Making public the breakdown of the Confederation, dragged with you almost all the AASR shops for recém_criada (22 May 1927) Grande_Loja_Simbólica of the State of Bahia, which in 1932 became only Grande_Loja of the State of Bahia . 
According to research our Irmão_José_Castellani scholar, the Grande_Loja_Unida of Bahia was constituted only March 26, 1954, as the successor of the Grande_Loja of Bahia, in the direction to resume many of the old shops, which had participated in the dissent, but they had already returned to Grande_Oriente of Brazil. 
The Schism however, not only caused the shops evasion the Grande_Oriente of Brazil to other Powers also fomented discord among Masons, especially those who are unaware of or ignore that Freemasonry, whatever the name or title that you will give, is, by its anti-dogmatic and universal, indivisible nature. 
The unfortunate occurrence has reached such a magnitude in Bahia, most of the stores at the jurisdictional Grande_Oriente of Brazil, transferred treated to a novel Power - The Grande_Loja_Unida of Bahia, getting a few of them. 
As the Masonic guidelines required a minimum of thirteen Lojas_Regulares so that it could create a Unidade_Estadual, and Grande_Oriente that Brazil suffered a blow, losing most of its shops in Bahia, it has -If impossible in the short term, the institution of the Grande_Oriente_Estadual of Bahia, however they wished their fans. 
As if that were not enough, shortly thereafter, Getúlio_Vargas deploys the dictatorship of the so-called Estado_Novo, fearing the growth of the Integralista_Brasileiro movement that had as leader Nacional_Plínio_Salgado. 
The dictatorship also did not support the ideals Masonic and moved to the terrible persecution Maçons_Liberais, closing therefore, most of the shops. 
even taking up the question of the Schism, it is evidence of title, transcribe, another important passage, say -If passing, documented in the report of the Irmãos_Carlos_Eugênio_Rangel, Alencastro_Morais and Raimundo_Moreira: 
It was a hope that new Masons started in the Grande_Oriente of Brazil, restructure it into Bahia and por_conseguinte, found the Grande_Oriente_Estadual of Bahia, whose idea had many supporters, even the Brothers Grande_Loja_Unida of Bahia who disagreed of the existing separatism. 
In this regard, a fact documented proves this statement: 
A Brother of the Glub, Florival_Bastos_Ferreira of the Loja_Filhos_de_Salomão, aware of the existence of a Loja_Maçônica_na_Ladeira_das_Fontes_das_Pedras, there appeared and requested entry into the Loja_Luz_e_Labor of the GOB, and - granted. 
A_partir_de then, he was a tireless fighter for the reunification unfortunately not yet performed. 
Shortly thereafter, in a Congresso_Maçônico promoted by the Eminentes_Grãos-Mestres_Estaduais the Soberano_Grão-Mestre_Geral informed management that he sent on along aa Confederation of the Grande_Lojas in the direction of spend Governo_Geral whom were elected by the Povo_Maçônico, desde_que if efetivasse the much desired reunification. 
Since the outbreak of the Schism in 1927 fomented by Mário_Behring, until the founding of the Grande_Oriente_Estadual of Bahia, according to records found and reported by the Irmãos_Rangel, Molinari, Alencastro and Raimundo, Foram_Delegados of the GOB in this State of Bahia the Irmãos_Ponciano_Moreira , Nelsom_Cândido_de_Lima, Willen_do_Prado_Moreira, Walke_Corrêa_de_Araújo and Bernado_Spector. 
Also in this period, it was founded a store for the Irmão_Ponciano_Moreira - The Loja_Rodrigues_Neves - that worked in the Terreiro de Jesus in the Centro_Histórico_de_Salvador. 
In 1950, the Lodges were founded:. 
The excitement did not stop there. 
Followed itself to these other shops facilities in the interior and in the capital, and already in 1956, had the Grande_Oriente of Brazil with thirteen shops in Bahia. 
Before the foundation of the Grande_Oriente_Estadual of Bahia, existing stores operated in two Headquarters: 
One in the Slope of the Source of the rocks, where they operated the Lojas_Luz_e_Labor and Cavaleiros_da_Fraternidade and the other in the Praça_Castro_Alves n.

The opinion of the commission is, in its broad lines, complimentary. 
in this document - also obtained by the note express If the following conclusions: 
The idea is not only very attractive, as it may result in a film and a television series very attractive; 
the argument is very good, based on truly exciting real facts; 
Vilar made a thorough job of research and documentation recompilation. 
in its assessment, the Spanish Commission detects and references some treatment defects of the text and building scenes. 
But says the information that the filmmaker contacted by telephone - gave its agreement on the correction and improvement of the script. 
António Vilar joined the Spanish second - the idea of ​​associating one or more screenwriters to the work of preparing the final script, a_partir_do their work.

All things considered, the historian hopes that the film will be a relevant projection event in one country and another. 
António_Vilar - 40 years ago is based in Spain - has worked for two decades in this project. 
It's the secret dream of a lifetime, several times confessed, in the last few months, in wheels of friends.

The script - which should lead to a full-length movie and a television mini-series of four chapters - was still leaded, according to the Express revealed last week by the Commission of the Discoveries. 
The decision, taken on the same day that Serra_Brandão resigned from the presidency, was proposed by Vasco_Graça_Moura, based on an opinion of Luís_Filipe_Barreto. 
The reproach is justified in a long document of 81 points - to which we referred in the same issue - which seeks to show that the argument is mediocre and rigor flawed. 
The decision not only frustrates the Portuguese-Spanish collaboration wishes expressed by the Iberian leaders like affront directly Veríssimo_Serrão.

to which alter the current composition of the Executive Secretariat. 
Refusal is also the Luís_Albuquerque position (71 years), had in some circles as the great candidate. 
Have not even been invited, I said to express the historian, who never hid his criticism of Serra_Brandão. 
In my view - he added - the Commission suffers from a basic error: 
It does not have people specialized in history that should possess. 
It must be a highly technical and specialized Commission. 
While this situation does not change, I can not accept the post. 
Couto_dos_Santos did not differ from the letter of resignation submitted by Veríssimo_Serrão, and has other layoffs succeed. 
The last to leave - according to our sources were the Executive Secretary, Rodrigues_da_Costa commander;

But the PSDB candidate Geraldo_Alckmin attended feijoada benefit in the court of the Empire samba school to Casa_Verde where came out in defense José_Serra, which competes São_Paulo to the government in the controversy involving prejudice against northeastern migrants.

After presenting median level games throughout the competition, led the rookie Dunga threw everything they could in the final and had the pleasure of lifting the cup to Brazil with a victory over Argentina. 
One wonders whether the achievement will not make up the current situation of the selection, which showed many flaws and brought players who failed to meet the expectations placed on them. 
But, truth be told, Brazil has invoked the maxim that? Classic is classic? and achieved a great victory over his more traditional rival.
Dunga won his first title as a coach and silenced critics throughout the country. 
Brazil is the best selection of the Americas for the eighth time.

The information revealed in the edition of this Thursday the Jornal_Nacional of TV Globo, was confirmed in a statement by the airline. 
Reporting by the Eliane_Cantanhêde columnist (available only for full newspaper readership or the UOL), published in the edition of the Folha de this Thursday, shows that new version of Infraero includes mechanical failure of the hypotheses for the accident --the most of the Brazilian aviation. 
TAM denied the hypothesis. 
Failure in the --mecanismo reverser that helps the aircraft to frear-- was detected by the electronic system for checking the aircraft itself, which continued flying in the next few days, with the right thrust reverser off. 
TAM said that the procedure does not constitute any obstacle to landing the aircraft. 
to the 18:50 of the last Tuesday without control, --which aircraft had taken off from Porto_Alegre-- passed the runway of Congonhas (south zone São_Paulo) with speed acima_do normal, crossed the busy avenue Washington_Luís and hit a building the company itself --of TAM Express. 
Além_dos occupants, the accident killed people on the ground, including employees of the trucking company. 
Until the night of this Thursday, firefighters confirmed the death of 188 people. 
The number can reach 200. 
De_acordo with the airline, the recommendation --fabricante Airbus avião-- the revision is that the reverser is made ten days after the defect was detected. 
For TAM, the fault does not prevent the realization of the flights. 
In 1996, a fault in the reverse has been the cause of the crash of the Fokker-100 TAM, occurred seconds after takeoff, also in Congonhas. 
on the occasion, 99 people were killed. 
If the possibility of a failure in the aircraft has caused the tragedy with Airbus, suspicions that the accident fault is related in the newly - reformed runway airport lose strength. 
The works were delivered incomplete without the so-called grooving (grooves that help in the flow of water) --which reduces the risk of skidding aircraft in case of rain. 
Also according to the Jornal_Nacional, the same plane had trouble landing one day before the accident, also in Congonhas. 
The flight, which had left Minas stopped only in the limit of the track. 
In a statement sent after the display of the report, TAM said it had no record of any mechanical problem in this plane on the 16th of July. 
Images recorded at Congonhas airport (south zone São_Paulo) issued on Wednesday (18) shows the time of the landing of Flight 3054 from TAM. 
Videos comparing landings of other aircraft with the Airbus A-320 crashed.

The president of Infraero (state which manages the airports of the country), Brigadier José_Carlos_Pereira said yesterday that the experts have detected strong smoke in the left engine of the Airbus -A320 of TAM in the film, according to the report published by The leaf . 
According to Brigadier, smoke introduces a new element at the beginning of the investigation: 
the possibility of mechanical failure in the equipment. 
The smoke, de_acordo to the report, may indicate that the engines were running in opposite directions, one driving forward and one braking, o_que explain, por_exemplo why the pilot failed to stop the plane, which continued very high speed after the floor and turned to the left at the end of the track, instead of going straight. nan nan After a fim_de_semana in the North and Northeast caciques next to PFL supporters of a more offensive campaign and hard speeches against Luiz_Inácio_Lula_da_Silva president, the candidate of the PSDB aa Presidency Geraldo_Alckmin, yesterday left the line peace and love and bowed aa high temperature of the presidential debate.
Alckmin accused Lula arrogant, underestimating the intelligence of the Brazilian and linked the president to the scandals of the monthly allowance, eao leech case Waldomiro_Diniz. 
Por_fim recommended humility to PT. 
in reality, the president turned his back to the Brazilian people, for justice and morality. 
He worked from the side of the Waldomiro (Diniz) of the monthly allowance of the leeches of the valerioduto of all these scandals. 
That's serious, the candidate responded aa Lula's statement that the PSDB abandoned the poor and that it is bias victim of the elites of the country because he did the opposite. 
The tone rise came in the moment of greatest crisis of the Alckmin campaign. 
on Friday, Senator Antonio_Carlos_Magalhães (PFL-BA) publicly exposed his irritation with the serene style of the toucan and took exactly o_que Alckmin did yesterday: 
necklace aa Lula image all cases of corruption that erupted in the current government. 
No mention by name the opponent Alckmin criticized Lula again commenting on speculation that the PT, convinced in the victory in the first round, was already making plans for his new ministerial team. 
It is an arrogant statement, because the campaign is beginning. 
It underestimates the intelligence of people. 
And pinned: 
Candidate must jump around with number 15. 
I go with the sandals of humility. 
Speaking at a charity lunch yesterday in the court of a samba school in the northern São_Paulo, the toucan joked: 
Humility is the highest stage of wisdom. 
Apesar_da the difference that separates it from Lula in the polls for the toucan is sure to confrontation with the president in a runoff. 
The election goes to a runoff. 
Are two, three dots and already gives second round, he said. 
There is another election. 
There is no way to escape the comparison and debate, nudged the toucan presidential candidate. 
But the turnaround in the toucan speech should not get to on TV as soon as ACM also claimed. 
According to the former governor, the strategy of prioritizing in the electoral program the TV to his biography has been well - successful and should not change, por_enquanto. 
You already realize in the street a big change. 
People are starting to want to know, know o_que made, said the toucan. 
To an audience of cerca_de 500 people, most of samba dancers, Alckmin highlighted its achievements in the government of the state to the black population and promised a_exemplo of what he did São_Paulo, regulate all areas of quilombos in Brazil. 
to get aa samba school, Alckmin, who said he was a devotee of São_Benedito, kissed and asked protection to an image of the saint placed on the entrance of the court. 
After the speech, he greeted from table to table the guests and served -If a feijoada dish. 
After eating, the candidate went to the dance floor and the sound of Alcyone, was played by the ladies of the old guard of the school. 
She danced with three in less than five minutes and needed the help of security guards to break away from the candidates for a new dance and go. 
I'm no expert, but I like to dance.

The family includes the elders (Sambucus gender), with some crop species and ethnobotany importance in many regions of Eurasia. 
The species belonging to the family Adoxaceae characterize If for having opposite leaves, with toothed margins, small flowers with 5, rarely 4, petals, grouped in inflorescences of the cimoso type. 
The fruit is a berry (sometimes drupe). 
When considering only the morphology, the plants included in this family show strong similarities with many Cornaceae. 
in the morphological basis of ratings, previous aa application of the concepts of the molecular phylogeny and modern biology, all kinds now included in the Adoxaceae were considered part of the Caprifoliaceae family, the family of the honeysuckle. 
The genus Adoxa with moschatellina Adoxa, was the first to be moved to the new group. 
Much later, the Sambucus genera (elders) and Viburnum (laurotinos or wafers) were added aa family after careful morphological analysis confirmed in biochemical data, o_que led Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group to include in the APG II system family with its present taxonomic division. 
An additional monotypic genus, the genus Sinadoxa was added based on molecular comparison with Adoxa genus. 
Some authors admit the existence of an additional monotypic gender, gender Tetradoxa. 
Gender type, Adoxa, groups small perennial herbaceous plants, compound leaves that bloom early in the spring and and that in the beginning of the summer dry to the ground just after the maturation of the drupe they produce. 
The species of the genus Sambucus (elders) are mostly shrubs, but two species are large herbaceous plants. 
The species of the genus Viburnum (laurotinos) are all shrubs, with simple leaves. 
Thus, in its present taxonomic division, the Adoxaceae family is a small family of shrubs or small trees (microfanerófitos or mesofanerófitos) or herbs perennial grouping species that are characterized for having opposite leaves, small flowers with five petals, grouped in dense panicles. 
They have in their cyanogenic glycosides tissues. 
The fruits are berries em_geral. 
It comprises four genera (although some authors consider an additional gender, Tetradoxa secreted from Adoxa) with the natural distribution mainly Hemisférios_Norte, but with a reduced number of native or naturally occurring in the Hemisfério_Sul. 
Cerca_de 220 are validly described species, and genera in the major number of species are Viburnum with cerca_de 166 species, Sambucus and with cerca_de 22 species. 
The leaves are opposite, simple or compound of the pinnate trifoliate whole or variously toothed, the lobed times with spanking or peninérvea venation; 
stipules absent or present, sometimes glandular. 
They have trichomes (per os) simple, stellate, glandular glandular or not, or in the presence of peltate scales. 
Have flowers grouped in certain inflorescences with umbeladas frequency. 
The flowers are bisexual, radial, with some species the sterile apresentarem_flores on the outskirts of the inflorescence. 
The sepals are connate, reduced to a single vascular stroke, with phyllotaxis (2) 5 parts. 
The petals are connate well developed and forming a short tube, or interwoven with valved lobes and phyllotaxis (5) 6 units. 
They have five stamens which are sometimes divided, like 10. 
tricolpados tricolporate or pollen grains, small to medium sized, crosslinked with exine. 
The carpels are conatos, ovarian inferior inferior or semi-axial and placentation, with a single locule, with only one egg is functional with a thin wall and megasporângio integument. 
The stilettos are short and capitate stigmas. 
The nectar is produced by a glandular tissue located in the apex of the ovary (Viburnum on) via the accumulation of a pillow-shaped (in Adoxa) or may be absent (in Sambucus). 
The fruit is a small berry (sometimes the drupe type) with 1-5 kernels (seeds). 
The berries are generally blue or red, and the small seeds dispersed by birds (ornithochory). 
The family is widely distributed in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, being represented in the América_do_Norte for Viburnum, Sambucus and Adoxa. 
However in the extends for Africa, North_America, Malesia, Australia and Nova_Zelândia, especially in mountainous regions. 
. 
in Brazil, the family is not endemic, and from 4-5 genera, only two are have naturally occurring in Brazil, Sambucus and Viburnum, and three species. 
of which two are native (Sambucus and Viburnum tinoides australis) is exotic and naturalized (Sambucus nigra). 
Its geographical distribution confirms the Northern region (Acre and Rondônia), Northeast (Alagoas, Bahia, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Rio_Grande_do_Norte, Sergipe), Center - West (Distrito_Federal, Goiás, Mato_Grosso_do_Sul), Southeast (Espírito_Santo, Minas_Gerais, Rio_de_Janeiro, São_Paulo) and South (Paraná, Rio_Grande_do_Sul, Santa_Catarina). 
The phytogeographic areas of its occurrence are Amazon, Cerrado, Mata_Atlântica; 
more specific in the types of vegetation anthropic area, deciduous forest, rain forest (= rain forest) and sandbank. 
Some species of Viburnum and Sambucus (elderberry) are widely grown as ornamentals, and fruits can be used for preparing jams and liqueurs. 
Além_disso this, many species also have medicinal importance. 
in the previous classifications, the family consisted of a single species, moschatellina Adoxa (a moscatelina). 
The Sambucus genres (including the elders) and Viburnum were included in the Caprifoliaceae family, but molecular data indicate that would be more appropriately in the Adoxaceae family. 
The monophyletic of Adoxaceae is supported by both morphological characters and by DNA sequences. 
Viburnum (Opuloideae) is the sister group of Sambucus + Adoxa rate and the like (Adoxoideae). 
This shows that compound leaves, simple perforations in the vessel elements, extrosas anthers and megagametophyte with the development Adoxa type. 
The monophyletic of the large and diverse genus Viburnum is supported by an abnormal development of the gynoecium in which two carpels are abortifacients and functional single egg is moved by developing themselves in a sterile locules. 
The absence of Sambucus nebulous in the genre has been suggested as a derivative condition but may also represent ancestral Dipsacales condition. 
The rhizomatous herb probably evolved three times dentro_de Adoxaceae, appearing in Sambucus Ebulus, Sambucus ADNATA rate and the like. 
The red fruit species, Sambucus pubens and Sambucus racemosa, form a monophyletic group and derivative thereof. 
The berries have evolved independently in the Viburnum and Sambucus genres. 
Various branches of the genus Viburnum are occupied by taxa that are currently tropical, so that may have occurred several transitions Evergreen with elliptical blades and entire margins for deciduous leaves with more rounded blades and serrated margins. 
Some authors suggest that diversification in the genre has been driven by extrinsic features, such as the occupation of mountainous regions in the South_America and east of the Himalayas, changes between cooler and warmer temperate forests, of which in intrinsic traits. 
The Adoxaceae family was proposed in 1839 by Ernst_Heinrich_Friedrich_Meyer in your Preussens_Pflanzengattungen work (plant Gender Prussia), p. 
198. 
Gender type is Adoxa_Os taxonomic synonyms for Adoxaceae are Sambucaceae and Viburnaceae. 
The results of sequencing of genes analyzes show that Adoxa and Sinadoxa foodstuffs together with the genus Sambucus and Viburnum, which were previously included in the Caprifoliaceae family, share a common ancestor, forming a clade that can be handled at the level taxonomic as one monophyletic family. 
Consequently, in the phylogenetic order of the underlying angiosperms the APG III system (and more recently APG IV) those genres have been grouped into a family Adoxaceae monophyletic. .
The family was part Adoxaceae 4-5 recognized genres, and the Oreinotinus gender is not consensual, why pela_qual the Adoxaceae family in the taxonomic circumscription given to him in 2011, it contains four genera with 220 species cerca_de:. nan nan A Rolex man suspected of stealing the watch of the Luciano_Huck television host was arrested on Wednesday, 16 in Taboão_da_Serra in the Grande_São_Paulo.

London, November 16, 2001) was an English spirit medium. 
Although his mediumship was manifested in many ways, has -If best known for the communication that claimed to have the spirits of famous composers of classical music, having received from them in the process similar to a psychographics, mais_de 400 scores. 
Among these spirits would Liszt (with o_qual had more frequent contact), Chopin, Schubert, Beethoven, Bach, Brahms, Schumann, Debussy, Grieg, Berlioz, Rachmaninoff, Mozart, among others. 
Some of them were often contact, others appeared to him a few times. 
Rosemary Brown was highlighted in the media in the 70s. 
Appeared on TV shows, among them a documentary for British broadcaster BBC in April 1969. 
on this occasion, he reached psychograph diante_das cameras an unprecedented score of Liszt. 
The produced part was called If Grübelei and high technical difficulty: 
had six sharps in the key and different measures for hands: 
5/4 to 3/2 in the right and the left. 
after psychographics, Brown said that the piece was too hard for her own run. 
A professional pianist then engaged in touch -la. 
Thereafter, the piece was analyzed by Grübelei Humphrey_Searle, British composer and great student of Liszt, who pointed out in his article, advanced harmonies and typical tone of the last compositions of Liszt. 
Rosemary Brown has written three books about his life and his mediumship. 
The first of them, published in 1971, received the title of Unfinished_Simphonies? 
Voices_From_The_Beyond, that in Brazil, received in the Portuguese title Contatos_Musicais? 
Grandes_Mestres_Compõem_do_Além, and it was published in 1991. 
The other two books without Brazilian version were: 
Immortals at my Elbow (1974) and Look_Beyond_Today (1986). 
After the release of his first book, he made public appearances in Europe and United_States. 
He played some of his songs in the Nova_York Prefecture and appeared in the The_Johnny_Carson_Show program. 
Three LPs containing some of the songs received by Rosemary_Brown were launched. 
The first was recorded in 1970 by the pianist Peter_Katin. 
The second came in 1977, by Howard_Shelley, and the last in 1988 by Leslie_Howard. 
Rosemary Brown was born in a poor family. Their psychic demonstrations began in early childhood, with banal facts.
Além_de see several anonymous spirits with startling clarity, also sensed facts and various events. 
Described as the house itself was many years before she was born, and even the street where they lived before the old house was built. 
Her mother and grandmother had also had some psychic manifestations throughout their lives, such as clairvoyance, although more rare and sporadic. 
Brown cites in his book, some of these manifestations of their ancestors. 
Also his two children (Thomas and Georgina) had mediumship. 
But none of them so intense and frequent as Rosemary. 
His music studies were very elementary, due to the lack of time and especially money. 
By the same token, never could also attend concerts, live with musicians or attend any music scene. 
These facts have been deliberately planned by the spirituality before she was born, so there was no doubt that the compositions could not come from itself. 
He worked as a lunch box at a public school in the time it began to receive the first scores. 
Both compositions as the medium were subjected to numerous tests and analyzes: 
musical, intelligence, psychological, psychic. 
It was declared perfectly ordinary, after careful studies, by prof. Tenhaeff_da_Universidade_de_Utrecht (Netherlands).
Among the spirits who communicate Brown claimed, he was also Sir_Donald_Tovey, musician, composer and writer illustrious, who died in 1940. 
It is attributed to this spirit the authorship of the text appearing on the cover of the LP released in 1970, explaining the purpose of spiritual communication. 
According to the message, the purpose of the composers disembodied transmit new musical pieces pa Earth after disembodied, is not vanity or mere intention to give pleasure to those who will listen to the songs. 
The purpose greater would serve as a demonstration over the immortality of the soul, prompting men to the existence of the spiritual life, and demonstrating that they are not mere bodies carnal doomed aa old age adn death, but immortal souls housed in bodies mortals endowed with a mind that is independent of the physical body. 
Brown also reports, in his first book, that sometimes his mediumship presented the aspect of healing. 
This phenomenon was given, according to their accounts, through communication with the spirit of Sir_George_Scott-Robertson, a distant cousin of his own Rosemary by the mother's side, and who died long before she was born. 
He had been a surgeon in life, and continued being in the spiritual world. 
Brown reports episodes of healing, and claims that this comes from a single source: 
the Força_Vital we call God. 
The production of psychic music ceased in the 80s, but Brown continued until the end of his life dedicated to his beliefs, and indifferent to material and worldly matters. 
The musical scores psychographic by Brown, as usual with all em_geral psychic manifestations, divide opinions. 
Skeptics seek to Brown's music, other explanations that obviate the possibility of existence of life after death, and also dismiss the alleged communication between living and dead (or between embodied and disembodied). 
He raised itself to hypothesis that Brown has had profound musical studies in childhood or youth, and has suffered an amnesia that made her forget that received these studies. 
But the doctor of the family easily refuted this explanation, as finished off nonsense. 
It is also suspected that she was hiding her true music knowledge in bad faith. 
Brown rebate, and claims in his book that the fact of having always lived in the same house since birth, has enabled most of the facts of his life could have been, over the years, thoroughly investigated. 
Neighbors, friends, relatives and several local authorities had witnessed on certain details. 
When it became known, Rosemary_Brown attracted the attention of big names in classical music, musicians and musicologists, who wanted to know her and her work. 
Richard_Rodney_Bennett said: 
Many people can improvise, but not able to compose music that way without years of study. 
I myself could not have created some of these Beethoven compositions. 
Hephzibah_Menuhin also impressed: 
There is no doubt that she is a very sincere person. 
The music is absolutely in the style of these composers. .
Some of the other professionals and music scholars who contacted him were Peter_Katin, David_Cairns, Humphrey_Searle, Tamas_Vasary, William, Jean and Julian_Lloyd_Webber, pianist and American composer John_Lill Leonard_Bernstein. 
None of them believed that Rosemary_Brown was some kind of fraud, although some will not accept a spiritual explanation for the origin of the songs. 
All, however, they were impressed by the sincerity and sensitivity of Brown. 
Many of them have established with the medium a friendship that lasted until the end of their lives. nan nan to leave the meeting of the toucans with the Minister of the Treasury, Guido_Mantega, Senator Sérgio_Guerra (PDSB-PE) said his party considered insufficient the proposal of the government, which would have been committed to raising the exemption limit of the CPMF for those with income up to R $ 4,340, rather than the R $ 1,642 traded so far.
Acima_desse this value, there would be a discount of R $ 214 in the Imposto_de_Renda.

- The proposal did not accept. 
It is not enough. 
The important thing now is to rebuild the party and put the PSDB in the tracks. 
The party will discuss the issue. 
The bench will discuss and will make a proposal - he said. 
According Sérgio_Guerra, the proposal by the government was basically the same made in the past week, only with the expansion of the exemption of the salary range for the payment of the tax. 
- There was no reduction of the sufficient charge, so do not accept the proposal - said the toucan, to be the new president of the party. 
A meeting of the executive of the party, which would give the final word on the agreement, was scheduled for the evening of Tuesday, but it was canceled, reports the Blog_do_Noblat.

- We have said that the proposal is inadequate, but we feel that the government still has fat to burn - said Virgil. 
The leader of the government in the Senate, Romero_Jucá (PMDB-RR), admitted that the government must give more conditions. 
Juca said in the However, the government has greatly improved the proposal to raise the exemption limit and offer a discount of R $ 214 in the Imposto_de_Renda for those with income acima_desse this value. 
According to him, for the proposed new government, a person who earns $ 9000, por_exemplo would pay only half of what you pay today. 
- We do not have fat, but we are aa willingness to negotiate more. 
I hope we can build an agreement - Juca said, stating that the PSDB was to discuss the proposal with the countertop and make a counterproposal to the government. 
in the meeting, the government also confirmed the other points of the agreed negotiating in the past week, except for the reduction of the transfer to the system S. The government also admitted extend the limit to the increase of the costs based on the inflation plus 2% of GDP to all current expenditures of the government, except for the Previdência_Social. 
This means that personnel expenses and material, por_exemplo, would have an annual growth limit plus 2% inflation. 
Toucans have had secret meetings with the government to negotiate other commitments, fora_da the official agenda, as a condition of approving the extension of the CPMF. 
Among the items under negotiation are the financial aid to states administered by governors of the PSDB, federal investments in toucans strongholds and to attempt an understanding by the end of reelection. 
That it was the formula found by the Plateau to help the dome of the PSDB to bar reactions of the base of the party against the extension of the CPMF.

After getting well, jumping safely to the 4m, Joan began to have problems in the approach run already in 4m10, showing nervousness and even giving jumps in the middle of the path. 
Other Brazilian athletes have felt the pressure of the crowd, as was the case of the girls volleyball, who delivered the gold to Cuba in the tie break and the athletes of artistic gymnastics, who committed consecutive errors clearly by nervousness. nan nan MILAN, 24 - The dream is over, yet this was not the return of the Sporting aa end of a European competition since twenty-seven years elapsed on its conquest of the Taça_das_Taças_63-64.
The leonine dream died in the famous stadium San_Siro and this, in the background, was the most predictable after being missed every opportunity that Sporting created to overcome the zero-zero in Alvalade ... 
Inter multi, multi-millionaire, Inter with so many super_vedetas (of Zenga, paragraph 1 of the Selection of Italy, the German trio Matthaus-Klinsmann-Brehme, all titularíssimos of the Nomination Germany world champion), did not waste their time to reach the end, a italianíssima end, Inter-Roma, exactly the executioners of Sporting and Benfica ... 
Let us agree that neither it took a super_Inter devastating in terms of major offensive pressure ... 
in this aspect, yes, there was some surprise ... 
... It is that of all the doubts that were placed for this decisive game, perhaps the greater the of whether this leonine team - apesar_do the merit of having restored the name of Sporting in the wheel of high European competitions as seventeen years did not happen, since the semi-final with the Germans in Magdeburg to the Winners Cup 74 - was able to withstand enormous pressure announced aa Inter logo in the first few minutes ... 
That's o_que most feared ... was nothing of what happened! 
Trappatoni is the kind of coach who bet acima_de all, in the absolute defensive security, being completely averse to taking risks ... 
So, for more than San_Siro public worship see their team in large avalanche offensive and in that sense was enormous pressure made by the Italian press (which from all forgot to Sporting ... 
leaving you in peace in their isolation in Lake Como, about 60 km from Milan), mais_ou_menos nem_pouco there was an Inter released in evil attack the game started ... 
Ou_seja, then, Inter gave up trumps to the lions, because, for the Portuguese perspective, what more was feared lack of defensive ability to endure a hard time ... 
The bottom line truth is that Sporting ... If delivered! 
The fear ... 
Fear undid the leonine dream. 
And this hara-kiri started was further ahead of the game ... 
Yes, in the course of his internship in Italy, the team was giving signs of disturbance, looking not believe in their ability to achieve the feat of, in San_Siro undo the tie in their favor coming from Alvalade. 
First, the name of the Inter immense grief ... 
but by what we observed, even greater weight had to defeat by FC Porto ... 
In our opinion, the debacle at his home, in front of FC Porto, tremendously marked the team of Sporting! 
Then barely started the clash on the Milanese land, at the end of a quarter - of an hour, when the tactical caution of the very Inter was to provide Sporting go dispelling their fears, ready, the folly of that penalty! 
A lack so indisputable quanto_desnecessária ... 
aa lack of confidence in himself that he sensed the Sporting before the game, added If another kind of toast ... 
amazing that penalty that virtually put end to the hypothesis lions estarrecerem San_Siro. 
What Inter was not even able to threaten, did it does in a minute, the hara-kiri Sporting ... 
That is : 
the great truth in it is that Sporting could not stand the psychological pressure of the famous face Inter in the famous stadium San_Siro ... 
If Recognize that was this easy victory of the Inter ... 
So easy that he did not even have a very inspired display ... 
Sporting, beating -If briosamente, was nothing more than that ... 
of this game and the psychological attitude of the Sporting face it, you can say was found that, after all, was not big giant Inter, but ... 
his name is huge ... 
... And that name what else weighed against Sporting. 
It frightened him. 
And that is the fundamental reason for the Sporting have not shown enough personality and competitive attitude enough to discuss, really, access aa end of the Taça_UEFA. 
It was fear of the Inter name what, acima_de all, stealing psychological force, disturbing, decentralizing, undid the leonine dream. 
It is sad to note was found that high-pressure Inter is something that never was, did not have to ... 
And ainda_assim, justice of the Italian triumph course has not discussion! 
Inter have a handful (for less) players with world-class. 
And your game has magnificent global organization .So Inter defends extraordinarily well and can high percentage of use of the chances that builds, or you are offered ... 
Tell was found that there is great conflict between the fans of Inter and Trappatoni coach, as a result of the game model, little offensive, apesar_de Matthaus, Klinsmann and not only ... 
So even be Inter in the final of the Taça_UEFA and in the second place of the championship of Italy, the coach will leave ... 
Very obvious in this game, the philosophy of Trappatoni: 
Total refusal to accept the risk of great offensive rhythm, striking option for waiting very, very patiently ... 
And the fault of Sporting, did not need a lot of patience. 
Fifteen minutes were enough for offering a penalty, Sporting surrender. 
True that de_imediato Lions tried to react, only that there was a lot of illusion in this pressure on the Italian midfield ... 
Because the strategy of Inter, with all the clarity was exactly this: 
there takes the ball, entertains -t with it, comes with it here, but here are nothing ... 
- and see there if you like my counterattacks ... 
on a counter attack ... 
2-0. 
Simplicity, effectiveness, talent ... 
And the defense leonine in this bid twice to let loose in an advanced large - area ... 
Inter, on the opposite pole, has a fabulous defensive organization! 
Marking capacity of its defenses and the strength of the collective scheme with a tick midfield, giving spaces, always em_cima_dos opponents in these marking tasks systematically integrating Matthaus himself, the great master Matthaus (almost certainly, in this moment, the best player of the world!), o_qual fight bravely, soak the sweater, chasing average to try to attack (in this game, especially marked the kid Philip) without him fall relatives in the mud. .. 
Example top playmaker seriously, of the complete footballer that modern football requires ... 
Matthaus this! 
The game model of the Inter is this, its major assets (para_além_do the large lot of individual talent) are the magnificent defensive organization and very good ability to counter-attack. 
The toast that Sporting, soon putting Inter to win, also offered aa team Trappatoni all the conditions for it to play in exactly the style that both like ... 
Sporting ... 
He got more time with the ball at his feet, but had no skill and art to seriously bother the lady defense - this is what the truth is. 
only exception: 
the drive that próximo_da half an hour, was well to the view the tie, wasted by Cadet, alone before Zenga as a result of excellent initiative ... Louie, defender; 
but Zenga Zenga is, great goalkeeper, and Cadet ... 
It precipitated. 
Acknowledge was found that the nature of the game was the one that Inter wanted ... 
With two goals to recover, Sporting had a balanced offensive always facilitated by the Italian strategy ... and also always bumping into an almost perfect defensive machine, unable to chew over what the ball, unable to create space for a shot. 
Anyway, Sporting was spirited, stubborn in the pursuit of a tiny thread of hope, but the confrontation with the magnificent defensive security that was to the front in this semi-final was, most clearly, this basic idea: 
longer (for more ... 
years) who were to play against this Inter (in Alvalade and San_Siro ...), this Sporting would not find way to score goals ... 
Marinho_Peres at the interval, made possible replacement ... 
Douglas exchanged (the defendant from the penalty spot and always uninspired) by advanced by the right (Litos) and said Gomes, who was virtually an average in the first half when Cadet and Balacov formed the duo advanced. 
But Sporting offensive had no momentum, psychological flow and ... 
talent for that magnificent defensive organization. 
And only in an accidental situation, creating opportunity for the defense Leal shot close to a pole, Sporting threatened to reduce the difference ... 
So that's ... 
Sporting a bit of harmless do_que ... 
An inter proving that without possible discussion is much more solid team and ... has much better players. 
Frustrating is complete is known that this Inter did not even have to do much convincing display to eliminate Sporting, with great ease. 
The French drove Biguet good positive game. 
The penalty, ensure repeat, was as unnecessary as indisputable. 
Only in one aspect arbitration appeared in less solid: 
in the first part little rigor in disciplinary matters, particularly when Klinsmann fora_do pitch, he slapped the Ocean and the card did not come out of the pocket of the Sr._Biguet. 
in the second half, the referee corrected this gap, and the balance of the hour-and-half, he can be said that did not influence the outcome and was not home. 
He even showed the yellow card Matthaus in a bid in which, finally, could no scandal tip, escape this punishment aa super_vedeta. nan nan Minister of Defense, Nelson_Jobim, must submit the name of the Solange_Vieira economist to take a the boards of the Agência_Nacional_de_Aviação_Civil (Anac).

Based on the resolution governing the work of the Ethics Board, may take the investigations without having to resort aa Polícia_Federal or wait a definition of the Supremo_Tribunal_Federal on any use of the president of the Congress. 
- We ourselves can make the relevant inquiries and ordering secrecy breaks as needed. 
But we will await the position of the Bureau today to decide what to do - says Senator Renato_Casagrande (PSB-ES), one of the rapporteurs of the process. 
The decision to Mesa_Diretora the Senate will today, 11 am. 
Renan Calheiros warned yesterday during a quick interview on the door of his office, which will not participate in the meeting and denied it was trying to maneuver to postpone the decision to release the questionnaire to the expertise, filed on Friday by the three the case of reporters - Casagrande, Almeida_Lima (PMDB -SE) and Marisa_Serrano (PSDB-MS) - and José_Nery Senator (PA), which is PSOL in the request for research on Renan. 
The intention of the rapporteurs to submit the questions aa table was to get an answer before the start of the recess. 
This would allow the expert to Polícia_Federal could work during the rest of the senators, and the return of the holidays, submit a detailed report on all documents - invoices, vaccination receipts, bank statements, delivery notes animals that Senator presented to justify the payment of the pension informal aa journalist Mônica_Veloso.

- Speak to me not worth - he said. 
Laconic, Senator said he has no intention of resorting to Supremo_Tribunal_Federal (STF) against the investigation of the Conselho_de_Ética. 
The matter came to light after aa his lawyer, Eduardo_Ferrão, questioned the legitimacy of the college and the very Polícia_Federal to investigate the case, since, as a senator, Renan would enjoy special privileges. 
at this point, only the Supreme could make the decision. 
The rapporteurs argue, the However, the police serve a timely request of the Council.

Renato_Casagrande and Marisa_Serrano think it was Renan himself who called for the investigation itself by announcing it was reversing the burden of proof to present the documents on the alleged sale of livestock operations. nan nan Pokémon_Diamond_e_Pearl in its first week of sales in Japan, hit record sales, topping Gold and Silver, the versions that sold more in the first week, and were also the best-selling game in Japan in 2006.

It is not necessary to Friend_Code in this mode.

He did more. 
With a team less trendy and diante_de an Argentine with key players applied a 3-0 --in 2004, the title came only in the penalty shootout. 
This is the first achievement of Dunga as a professional coach. 
And without the two main stars of Brazilian football today. 
Kaka and Ronaldinho asked the waiver Copa_América claiming fatigue. 
The first title of the new era Dunga was just em_cima of the opponent who made the expression is coined soon after the 1-0 to Argentina in the World Cup-90, which eliminated Brazil.

He entered by the right and crossed creeping. 
Ayala Vágner_Love anticipated, but sent the ball into his own net. 
in the second time, Argentine pressure increased. 
But the space for counter attacks as well. 
That's when the pair of wheels and Joshua Miner, climb during the competition, appeared more. 
With tackles in the middle, the former are Pauline who were initiated plucked to the opponent field, unguarded defenders. 
That's how Brazil killed the game. 
One of the tackles reached Vágner_Love. 
The striker, who in the Copa_América scored only once, gave a precise pass to Daniel_Alves cross kick dentro_da area and mais_uma_vez leak goalkeeper Abbondanzieri. 
Brazil's victory also came with a special taste.

Very early, with only 18 years old, he began his public life as Oficial_de_Gabinete_do_Governador of the State of Bahia in 1973, when his father was governor for the first time. 
Two years later he became Chefe_de_Gabinete_do_Primeiro - Secretário_da_Assembleia_Legislativa of Bahia, staying until leaving state representative candidate with only 23 years and then winning the race in 1979.

Apesar_de its firm stance in the Congress, as in the impeachment Sérgio_Naya, the destroyer of the Palace_II, was not interested in state politics and only ran the Bahian interior in the time of elections, unlike his father.

Its construction began in the year 936 AD at the behest of Abderramão_III first Caliph of Al-Andalus, and the main reasons for its construction were political and ideological nature:

Além_de political opponents, were also on the religious level, since the Fatimids, Shia, were enemies of the Umayyads, mostly of Sunni Islamic branch.

To the east of the hall, and connected with it, they were built a set of rooms paved in white marble, as well as the so-called patio the sink, which is part of the previous resorts to a bath of reduced proportions. 
The five ships of the room opens into Casa_dos_Vizires for a wide and high sidewalk of the lowering stairs to a giant square square, now adapted as garden. 
About the function of this building there are different opinions. 
For a long time it was called the Casa_do_Exército as measurements of the room and the esplanade seem to allude to representative functions.

If built a series of rooms frente_à the main facade of the mosque, which in the distribution and location, can be identified as an alms house (dar al-Sadaka). 
Apesar_da wealth and strength of the materials used, Medina_Azahara failed to survive even a century after its construction, it was demolished and looted in 1010, as a result of the civil war (or fitna) that ended the Caliphate of Cordoba. 
His serve and dismantling continued in the succeeding centuries, because it was used as artificial quarry for the construction of other buildings later in the city of Cordoba. 
One of the most important objects found was the ivory box with inscriptions calling ciborium Al-Mughira, which is preserved in the museum of the Louvre.

Lib'nah dingil) was Ethiopia (1508 - 1540), a member of the Dinastia_Salomónica. 
He was son of the emperor and the queen NaOD Woizero_Atitegeb_Wondbewossen. 
It was with this emperor that the Portuguese for the first time made contact in the search for the Preste_João during the initial phase of the expansion to the Oceano_Índico. 
Lebna Dengel inherited the throne of Ethiopia as a child, by pelo_que his grandmother, Queen Eleni of Ethiopia, apesar_de have already mais_de 70 years old, assumed the regency of the empire, ruling in the name of his grandson until 1516, year he took over completely power. 
Daughter of a Muslim prince, Eleni was aware that Islamic states were neighbors to benefit from the assistance of other potentates Muslims, especially the Império_Otomano rising at the same time he knew of the growing Portuguese presence in the Oceano_Índico. 
in an attempt to neutralize the advantage of Muslim neighbors, apparently Pero board of the Covilha, in the meantime reached the Ethiopian court, decided to try a contact with the Portuguese Christians, sent as ambassador to Portugal and to Rome one Mataus name cleric the Armenian, who became known in the Portuguese historiography by Matthew Ethiopia, with a request for help in the fight against the growing power of Islam in the region. 
The long journey, via Goa until aa cutting D._Manuel I of Portugal and back took almost a decade, since the application only been answered with the arrival of a Portuguese aa Ethiopia embassy led by D._Rodrigo_de_Lima, who arrived in Massawa the April 9, 1520. 
Traveling through the Ethiopian highlands, the embassy only reached Dawit camp on 19 October of that year. 
Francisco_Álvares, which was part of the embassy, ​​described the emperor as they should, 23, complexion comparatively light and medium complexion. 
The work of Francisco_Alvares gives a detailed description of Ethiopia of that time, especially the religious habits and the clergy. 
However, in July 1517 Dawit had ambushed the Mahfuz_do_Sultanato_de_Adal killed the emir, about the same time that a Portuguese fleet commanded by Lopo_Soares_de_Albergaria_atacava_Zeila, a major port and Muslim bastion, looting and burning the village and fortress. 
In 1523, Dawit conducted a successful campaign against the Gurage people in the vicinity of the Lago_Zway. 
Given his victories, his advisers concluded that the Islamic threat was removed, why pela_qual when the Portuguese embassy finally arrived in 1520, Dawit denied that Matthew had authority to negotiate treaties, ignoring the advice of the Queen Elena. 
After a stay of six years, in 1526 the Portuguese abandoned Ethiopia, leaving para_trás a ruling class that felt safe and firmly in control of the power, but, as noted by Paul B. 
Henze, they were wrong because the war with the Adal Sultanate If approached and the Muslim power, with Ottoman support, ensure reinforced. 
With the death of the Sultan Abu_Bakr in 1520, a young imam name Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al - Ghazi consolidated his power over the Sultanato_de_Adal, putting on the throne its candidate, Sultan Umar_Din. 
Consolidated the new power, Abu_Bakr decided to launch a military campaign in order to subdue the Império_Etíope and destroy the Christian power in the region of the Corno_de_África. 
To this end, in 1528, the forces of the Sultanate, led by the Ahmad_Gragn magnet, crossed the river Awash and entered Fatagar, looting and burning city of Badeqe before Dawit could get there with his army. 
After the serve, the forces of the Imam began a hasty retreat across the river Samara, a tributary of the Awash. 
This procedure was typical, as the forces of the magnet were accustomed to making quick attacks on Ethiopian territory, attacking and withdrawing de_surpresa immediately to its territory, having no experience in sustained wars. 
When the magnet Ahmad_Gragn intended return and permanently occupy Ethiopian territory suffered numerous defections and was forced to postpone this goal. 
The forces of the Emperor Dawit persecuted and attacked the troops of the Ahmad_Gragn magnet, catching the 7 or 9 March 1529 the battle of Shimbra_Kure in which failed to destroy the troops of the magnet. 
This battle, apesar_de not be a clear vitóriapara Muslim forces, proved that the Ethiopian troops were not inconvencíveis, marking a turning point in the relationship between the two powers. 
The Ahmad_Gragn magnet spent the next two years on the banks of the river Awash, strengthening his forces, and returned to attack Ethiopia in 1531, and then routed the army Ethiopian commanded by the Eslamu general, firing the first cannon used in the Corno_de_África , offer the Ottomans. 
Dawit was forced to seek refuge in the Ethiopian highlands, and fortify If behind the canyons of Bet_Amhara (the Casa_de_Amhara), leaving the territories to the east and south under the protection of your Wasan_Sagad general. 
However, Wasan_Sagad was hit and killed near the Monte_Busat while fighting the forces of Urai_Utman the July 29, 1531 (5 Nahase 1524 in the Ethiopian calendar) and his broken army. 
The magnet managed to surprise the emperor in the battle of Amba_Sel, fought on 27 October of that year, almost getting your catch, a result that left Lebna_Dengel in the position of never able to offer sustained resistance against their enemies. 
Broken the Ethiopian resistance, the imam and his followers went into Bet_Amhara, plundering all the churches they found, including Mekane_Selassie, Atronsa_Maryam, Debre_Nagwadgwad and Ganata_Giyorgis. 
The Emperor Dawit was forced to retreat to além_do If the river Abay, in the relative safety of the Gojjam region. 
Only the failure to capture the royal palace in Amba_Geshen delayed the Islamic advance. 
in the campaigns that followed, Ahmad's followers destroyed churches and monasteries and converted aa power of the sword Christian populations who fell under their control. 
In April 1533, Ahmad returned to gather his troops in Debre_Berhan to win? or the menos_destruir?
northern Tigray, Begemder and Gojjam, campaign took out successfully. 
Both Ethiopia and Dawit suffered heavily with these attacks. 
The Debre_Libanos monastery was burned and churches and villages on the islands of the Lago_Tana were looted. 
The April 7, 1537, Fiqtor, the eldest son of Dawit, was killed in the clash of Zara in Wag by one of the valid Ahmad; 
the other her children, Menas, was captured on May 19, 1539, and sent captive to Yemen. 
Amba Geshen surrendered themselves in an assault carried out in January 1540, with real prisoners interned there been killed together with his guards and ransacked the real treasure. 
During the years he lived as an out-of-law in their own land, Dawit understood the wisdom of the Eleni queen when advised to request European aid, reason pela_qual he decided to send João_Bermudes, a Galician cleric service the Portuguese who remained held in Ethiopia which had come to the embassy of D._Rodrigo_de_Lima to request the assistance of European Christians. 
However, the Portuguese aid, a force of 400 men commanded by Cristóvão_da_Gama only reached Ethiopia after Dawit have already been killed in battle in the vicinity of Debre_Damo, to September 2, 1540. 
The Ethiopian historian Taddesse_Tamrat wrote that the Muslim occupation of the Christian Ethiopian highlands under Ahmad_Gragn lasted just over a decade, between 1531 and 1543, but the destruction which brought in these years can only be estimated in centuries. 
One of the young children of Dawit, Yaqob, have been hidden in the province of Menz in Shewa. 
The grandson of Yaqob, Susenyos defeated several of his cousins ​​in 1604 and became emperor If, starting the Gondar line of the Solomonic Dynasty. nan nan As expected, Fabiana_Murer athlete won the gold medal - the 29th Brazilian - in the pole vault in the Jogos_Pan-Americanos_do_Rio on Monday in the Estádio_João_Havelange.
De_quebra this achievement equals the number of billed gold medals in Santo_Domingo (2003), when Brazil also added 29. 
This record must be broken in this edition of the Games. 
Murer - runner-up to Copa_do_Mundo 2006 - won the highest place of the podium with the 4m60 mark against 4M40 of the American April_Steiner who took silver. 
But the bronze belongs Cuban aa Yarisley_Silva with the mark of 4.30 m. 
Already another Brazilian who participated in the race, Joana_Costa did not go up to the podium as it did not reach the mark of the Cuban. 
The athlete of Campinas started the race in the 4.30 m mark, and his jump was perfect, giving HIM cheer even to send kisses to the fans. 
Good jump Brazilian put pressure on the US, who failed in his first attempt at the jump of 4.40 m. 
Best for Fabiana_Murer, which reached such score in his first jump, raising the public. 
The American athlete proved that the dispute would be fierce, as it hit the mark of 4.40 m, even with the boos from the home crowd. 
Fabiana_Murer in the however, does not seem bothered, but missed his first attempt to reach 4.50 m; 
the error was not repeated and Brazil reached that mark at the second attempt, breaking the record pan - American, guaranteeing gold. 
Without competition, Murer went in search of breaking his own record, and his third attempt, he managed to reach 4.60 m. 
His best mark is 4.66 m. nan nan President Luiz_Inácio_Lula_da_Silva said on Tuesday, 25, in the opening of the 62nd Assembléia_Geral of the UN, that biofuels do not affect food security.
The sugarcane takes up only 1% of our arable land. 
Lula said he will define which areas will be used aa ethanol production in the country. 
The president said that Brazil will host in the next year, an international conference on biofuels, and called on all countries to participarem_do the event. 
According to Lula, the world urgently needs a new energy matrix. 
Ethanol can be much more than an alternative clean energy. 
The problem of hunger in the world is not due to lack of food but lack of income that afflicts almost one billion men, women and children, he said. 
Lula pointed out that with the Programa_Fome_Zero, managed to achieve the first point of the Goals of the Millennium - eradicate hunger - with ten years in advance, reducing by more than half extreme poverty. 
The Brazil will all social and environmental guarantees aa biofuel production, he said in the speech. 
Lula pointed ethanol and biodiesel as poor countries and developing opportunities have energy independence without major investments. 
Can generate employment, income and promote family farming. 
The president also said that biofuels have prevented 644 million tons of CO2 were dumped into the atmosphere. 
There will be no solution to the terrible effects of climate change if humanity is not able also to change their patterns of production and consumption, he said. 
President Lula stressed that industrialized countries must set an example in the fight against global warming and said it was essential that they meet the goals of the Protocolo_de_Kyoto. 
According to the president, cada_um of us must do our part in this task, but it is not permissible that the cost of the shortsightedness of the privileged few be shouldered by the dispossessed of the earth. 
Lula said that Brazil intends to host in 2012 a new conference to discuss environmental issues, the Rio + 20, to assess the results of the ECO-92. 
The president praised the fall in the rate of deforestation of the Amazon, who claimed to have fallen to less than half. 
There is the work of chance. 
Brazil does not abdicate, under any circumstances, of its sovereignty or its responsibilities in the Amazon. 
The rate of deforestation in the Amazon fell 25%, down from 27 thousand square kilometers in 2004 to 14,000 km in 2006, dentro_do the action plan for prevention and control of deforestation. 
Lula's speech at the UN placed great emphasis on the end of agricultural protectionism. 
the exorbitant farm subsidies are unacceptable, that enrich the rich and impoverish the poor, the president said. 
According to Lula, overcoming poverty requires new economic relations, which do not penalize poor countries. 
The Rodada_de_Doha of the WTO should promote a true pact for development by adopting fair and balanced rules for international trade. 
For Lula, the construction of a new international order is not a figure of speech, but a good sense requirement. 
He cited also the creation - Brazil, India and África_do_Sul - an innovative forum for dialogue and joint action, IBSA. 
We have even made concrete cooperation projects in various countries, a_exemplo Haiti and Guiné_Bissau, amended. 
We make no mistake: 
the global development model is not rethought, growing risks of an environmental and human catastrophe without precedent. 
Lula cited positively the proposal of French President Nicolas_Sarkozy to expand the Conselho_de_Segurança of the UN, with the permanent inclusion of developing countries. 
Brazil has historically struggle for the right to vote in the organ. 
It's time to move from intentions aa action, he said. 
For the president, the Nações_Unidas are the best tool to face the challenges of the world today. 
It is in the exercise of multilateral diplomacy that we find the means to promote peace and development, amended. 
He cited that the participation of Brazil, together with other countries of the América_Latina and the Caribbean in the Stabilization Mission in Haiti, symbolizes the commitment to strengthen multilateralism .In Haiti, we are showing that peace and stability They are built with democracy and social development.

The Brazilian president stressed that the suffering expressed in the wall War refers aa high responsibility of the Nações_Unidas to avoid the risk of armed conflict. 
The second mural, peace, according to Lula, reveals that peace is much além_da the absence of war. 
Presupposes well - being, health and a harmonious coexistence with nature. 
It requires social justice, freedom and overcoming the scourges of hunger and poverty. 
Also in the speech, Lula said it is no accident that the war wall is placed in front of arrivals, and the Peace Wall, who comes out. 
The message of the artist is simple but powerful: 
turn afflictions into hope, peace in war, is the essence of the mission of the Nações_Unidas. 
Brazil will continue to work so that this expectation as high a reality, he said. 
The murals painted by the Brazilian artist denounce violence and exalt love and understanding. 
Portinari used not only his work in favor of peace, but also politically militated in favor of this objective. 
The murals presented by the Brazilian government aa UN in 1957, portray this attitude. 
To perform the job, experts point out that Portinari held four years of preparatory studies. 
The piece consists of two panels made of plywood oil, 14 meters high by ten meters wide and was performed in nine months. nan nan Religion in the United_Kingdom is one of the oldest religious manifestations of the Western world, having origin for cerca_de 1400 years - when the arrival of the first Christian missionaries.
Since then, Christianity has been the largest and most influential religious denomination in the country; 
through its two main streams: 
Anglicanism and Roman Catholicism. 
The origin of Anglicanism back aa consolidation Absolutism in the fifteenth century. 
The Roman Church, por_sua_vez, sought to maintain its activity in the country by sending missionaries and representatives. 
More recently, the increase in immigration rates, resulted in the incorporation of new doctrines for much of the British. 
The Tratado_de_União, which took one of the training United_Kingdom assured that there would be a Protestant succession as well as a link between church and state that still remains. 
Christianity is the largest religion, followed by Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and Judaism in terms of number of adherents. 
in the 2011 census, 59.5% of respondents said that Christianity was their religion, at the However, a study of Tearfund showed that only one in ten Britons actually attend church weekly. 
Cerca_de 16 million people (25% of the population of the United_Kingdom) said they had no religion, with over 4.3 million (7% of the population of the United_Kingdom) not stating a religious preference. 
Between 2004 and 2008, the Office_for_National_Statistics reported that the number of Christians in Britain (instead of the United_Kingdom as a whole) fell by more than 2 million people. 
The official religion of the United_Kingdom is the Church of England, whose sovereignty is guaranteed by the monarch. 
In contrast, Igreja_Presbiteriana is the official religion of Scotland, one of the countries that make up the United_Kingdom. 
The Adventist Igreja_Batista and also profess, and Islam and Judaism, together forming more numerous. 
British law guarantees freedom of worship, although some constituent nations accept a religion as official; 
and others (such as Irlanda_do_Norte_e_País_de_Gales) declare If aconfessionais or lay states. 
What makes up United_Kingdom Since 1707 consisted of independent nations and, as a result, much of the Christian denominations do not have a structure to British national. 
While some maintain individual structures for each constituent country of the United_Kingdom, others maintained a unique supranational structure over the centuries. 
The same happened in 1921 with the creation of the Irlanda_do_Norte, which has linked their religious organizations even those of Ireland. 
Christianity was spread by the Romans in some parts of England and Scotland. 
After the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons in the fifth century, the Roman Church authorities reenviaram missionaries in order to expand the Christian faith throughout the known territory. 
With that came the current Ireland. 
The Catholic Church remained the majority religion during Idade_Média and up to half of the Idade_Moderna, during which Henry VIII breaks with official papal authority and establishes a national church. 
The largest religious group in Britain is Christianity, with the Church of England (Anglican) church and state: 
the church retains a representation in the Parliament of the United_Kingdom and the British monarch is a member of the church (in the terms of Article 2 of the Tratado_de_União) and the Governador_Supremo. 
The Church of England also reserves the right to draft legislative measures (related aa religious administration) through the Sínodo_Geral, which can then be passed into law by Parliament. 
The Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales is the second largest Christian church with cerca_de five million members, mainly in England. 
There is also a growing number of Orthodox, Evangelical and Pentecostal, and the Pentecostal churches in England passed the third, atrás_da the Church of England and the Church Católica_Romana in terms of aa church often. 
The largest religious group in Scotland is also Christianity, although the Presbyterian Church of Scotland (known informally as The_Kirk), is recognized as the national church. 
It is not subject to the control of the State and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to take an oath to maintain and preserve the Protestant religion and the Presbyterian Church of the Government at the time of his accession to power. 
The Catholic Church in Scotland, is the second largest Christian church in Scotland, o_que is a sixth of the population. 
There is also the Igreja_Episcopal_Escocesa, which is part of the Comunhão_Anglicana. 
The Church in Wales is secular, but remains in the Comunhão_Anglicana. 
The União_Batista_de_Gales, the Methodist and the Presbyterian Church of the Wales are present in Wales as well. 
The main religious groups in the Northern Ireland are organized on the same basis of the rest of Ireland. 
Though Protestants and Anglicans are most generally, the Catholic Church of Ireland is the largest single church. 
The Presbyterian Church in Ireland is the second largest church followed by the Church of Ireland (Anglican), which was liquidated on the. 
Other Christian groups of great expression in the country are the Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers and Methodists. 
And in the United_Kingdom it originated the Movimento_de_Santidade but spreading through the names in America and led to a reformulation of its doctrines. 
In 1753, Parliament allowed the naturalization of Jews living in the country. 
in the following years this religious group was gradually gaining greater freedom of expression, -If start with the graduation of a Jewish unidentified in the Universidade_de_Glascow in 1787 and lifting Sir_Isaac_Goldsmid the baron in 1841. 
In 1958, the banker Lionel_de_Rothschild was admitted to the Câmara_dos_Comuns, ceasing the restriction to Christians in this reigned. 
With cerca_de 263,000 British Jewish descent, the United_Kingdom is the fifth largest Jewish community in the world (surpassed only by United_States, France and Canada). 
It is to be noted that these statistics do not include the amount of Jews only by ethnicity. 
in the 2001 census, there were Muslims in England and Wales, accounting for 3% of the population. 
Muslims in Scotland are people, representing 0.84% ​​of the population. 
According to an estimate from the Labor Force Survey, the total number of Muslims in Britain in 2008 was cerca_de 4% of the total population. 
There were over 1943 Muslims in Ireland of the North in 2001. 
More than a million people follow religions of Indian origin: 
They are Hindus, Sikhs and are cerca_de practice Buddhism. 
Leicester has one of the few Jaina temples of the world who are fora_da India. 
The number of British Jews are people. 
The United_Kingdom has the fifth largest Jewish community worldwide. nan nan Fifteen funcionÃ¡rios places a £ organizaÃ§Ã the French charity in the Sri_Lanka were found dead in the town of Muttur in the north of the country.

Boo and applause are two moments of reaction of the human being. 
The only thing I particularly makes me sad is that I was prepared for a party. 
It's like I was invited to the birthday of a friend of mine got there and found a group of people who did not want my presence there. 
I'm sure that this is not the thought of the Rio_de_Janeiro. 
After the event ended, several people came to say that it had been arranged that we had received the invitation. 
To me, no matter what happened to me, it happened. 
The important thing is that it was an extraordinary opening Jogos_Pan the American said. 
Lula also commented on the importance of the Pan to Rio. 
I am aware of what is the Rio in Brazil. 
I am aware that the people of the Rio_de_Janeiro have their self-esteem in this very best time to what had three, four years ago. 
We will work, we have many projects to work on the Rio_de_Janeiro and we will work in the Rio_de_Janeiro. 
This (the booing) does not change a millimeter my behavior with Rio_de_Janeiro. 
The Rio_de_Janeiro we could say still beautiful and deserves the federal government to do what it can to Rio_de_Janeiro. 
. 
And he reiterated: 
The party was an extraordinary thing. 
Before the party, I had the opportunity to visit the Vila_Olímpica and talk with athletes from various countries of the world who were there. 
Unânime_dizer was that no one had ever seen anything with the quality that Brazil was offering in the Vila_Olímpica. 
Athletes saying about the courts that they would participate. 
The president also spoke about the investments of the federal government to the sports centers. 
I believe it is necessary that all of us Brazilians are aware that the Rio_de_Janeiro deserved an event of this magnitude. 
Deserved the investments that the federal government has put there, US $ 2 billion. 
We place because we are aware that the Rio_de_Janeiro is an important state in Brazil, which is important to us to show an extraordinary quality of the services we are offering, especially for the location of the events in which athletes will participate, for the matter of public safety.

in the last part, Finland again paired the game with Brazil until the middle of the set, but after a sequence of points Brazilians failed to react and lost by 25-21. nan nan By decree of Manuel_da_Silva_Passos of September 19, 1836, bullfighting in Lisbon, were prohibited for being fun barbaric and unworthy of civilized nations, serving only to accustom men to the crime and found it fiercely.
The confrontation with this legal determination on bullfighting Lisbon led me, almost without realizing it, a walk in the past of the time to know, by the press, the ultimate reasons of this implacable order. 
The texts found are not always the most convincing even the most critical situations that the law want to weed out. 
But let's get down to business . 
We found the mention of three bullfights held in the Terreiro_do_Paço in October 1661, on the occasion of the Bragança D._Catarina's marriage to Charles I of England. 
Popular, says the chronicle, in anxiety not to miss this beautiful show, literally filled the places were reserved them. 
Mariolas of Ribeira acamaradavam with saloiada of the gardens of Loures and Fine; 
almoinheiros, rascoas, moneychangers, lackeys, regatões and sailors, all jostling, if pressed, would, chalaceava in the desire to enjoy the day and not to miss the smallest episode party both your liking. 
This reveals description, in its detail, habits and attachment from Lisbon to bullfighting. 
Therefore, continue in the citation of the Arquivo_Alfacinha, 1953, we've been doing. 
Shortly after hitting noon in the tower of the clock of the Palace and the numerous steeples of the devout Lisbon eighteenth century, rushed If the curtains of the royal grandstand and it appeared the real people. 
The crowd barely saw the figure of the boy and his sister, already considered the Queen of Britain, put foot -If and began in a thunderous acclaim of sympathy, revealing the love, then joined the people aa royalty . 
The narrative is long. 
But we could not resist, to finish, to transcribe a scene to portray the behavior of the popular warm ovation. 
A boy, seeing the failure of iron, forward, fearless, to meet the bull, clapped his hands, opened his arms, he gave HIM land and fell masterfully dentro_da the cornadura the à_qual be held with soul, so that assistance taxed you the warmest of ovations of that distant afternoon. 
The night approached If frigidíssima. 
Assistance was shaking with cold, but by the last bull, nobody budge, whether it was noble, or lackey friar. 
This Lisbon taste for bullfighting walked also connected to a large predilection royalty. 
Thus, in the second quarter of the seventeenth century, it appears -In the king D._Pedro_II passionately connected to this aficción in the courtyards of the palace of Alcantara. 
This king, writes -In Aires de Sá in Bullfighting in Portugal, used in his palace Alcantara, amuse herself, often times in your favorite exercise is running on a horse with the lance the bull; 
doing this with admirable dexterity and accuracy. 
Not content with exposing themselves to horse against a furious animal, attacking it often walk (...). 
It is seen in these clashes, the first hasty nobility, em_volta_do the bull, grabbing him, cada_um por_onde can for the horns, for the topside, by the tail. 
It was the Queen who depart from these exercises. 
When he knew that the king exercised in such a thing, ensure Metia immediately in the carriage and ran Alcantara; 
logo had just fun. 
But the enthusiasm of the very quickly bulls changed the Terreiro_do_Paço by the garden of the Annunciation, which is cluttered, so that the square is almost on the floor of the house of the Earl of Castelo_Melhor according Rodovalho_Duro data in História_do_Toureio in Portugal . 
The author reports this event to 1771. 
And this would be a small step in the life of bullfighting in Lisbon, because between 1777-1780, would be built to the bullring of the Salitre. 
The soul of this construction and its first manager would have been the João_Gomes_Varela apothecary, are to give faith to the news published by Matos_Sequeira master, that being good handler of herbal teas and man of the theater, and sobraçava the cover up of bullfighting, saw business in a square where, with permanence, were explored the taste that the people of Lisbon always expressed by the wild party. 
If the source of this square is a source of disagreement with the writer Eduardo_Noronha, which claimed its founding to a sort of union, its architecture is also cause for disagreement. 
Also according to Eduardo_Noronha, the architect of the square it copied faithfully from the old square of Madrid, circular and wide, but Matos_Sequeira, the square of the Salitre appears on a square. 
On one side of the amphitheater had cabins for aficionados of social price, allocating If one of them aa authority that was then the mayor of the Remolares neighborhood; 
of the other hand, plenty of places. 
All around, the stands for the little people. 
Bullfighting the square of the Salitre findaram themselves in 1830. 
A circus happened HIM as a legacy of death. 
And in 1879, imperative to target this city that began to grow a_partir_do the beginning of the Avenida_da_Liberdade, laid down the old square, joyful pastime of our grandmothers. 
from the customs of Lisbon of the nineteenth century, toiradas occupied the first part of the heart of these city dwellers with tired eyes Tagus. 
And, it was in the Praça_do_Campo_de_Santana who lived the best evenings of the Portuguese bullfighting. 
And are the written testimonies of the time they will be able to guide you in the knowledge of this taurine practice of the capital, where the so-called gang was a very curious and indispensable to prepare a wedge aa square. 
The band was - in the words of Eduardo_Noronha - a picturesque and ragged ride, a brass band consisting of low skilled performers, to touch the instruments full of dents, tune songs, but clamorous, accompanied by numerous hissing and rapazio noisy, called the windows and population half doors that rushed to run the race the next day (...) 
When you hear, ensure fantasize, glimpsed herself, the adventures varied a good afternoon of bulls in the Praça_do_Campo_de_Santana, with the blue sky to unfold If por_cima_da competition, the sun afoguear the face of the bystanders, the younger kids scream, the seller of fresh water to proclaim and the animal out of the cage angry, furious fuming by their noses, jumping like a deer in the arena wheel in a whirlwind of dust. 
And is the prince Lichonowsky, quoted by Francisco_Câncio_in_Aspectos_de_Lisboa of the Século_XIX, we will learn some of these characteristics of the Portuguese bullfighting ... 
When the bull is not angry or not interested in the fight, or if he has been very harassed, are launched against him Galicians, or black, providing then a similar service to the dogs that the Spanish people usually ask with instance, through the cry known perros, every time, the bull shown more peaceful (...) 
The Galicia since the signal (and not cappies) to release the side rakes (to be enforced) and run on bull; 
o_que is more spirited put themselves in front of it, and causes it takes the time when the animal precipitates, low and eyes closed head to jump between the ends it, clings to às_quais strongly leaving If take violently rojo. 
Other Galician throw herself, immediately on the bull holding him by the legs, horns and tail, or even ride on it until the animal which muitas_vezes drags a dozen of those individuals, it is forced to stop. 
Calls themselves to this grasp the nail pa ... Ox 
The literature of the nineteenth century collected the testimony of a charioteer of Lisbon, named The Abafado_Velho to characterize the days of bullfighting Lisbon. 
Let us not speak of the bulls that waits until I grow water in your mouth! 
What life... 
There for eight and a half the night, began to leave the slings, ajoujadas of noblemen and womenfolk. 
It was a torn spree. 
in that time, the car had no brakes, but we climbed and descended almost to fly, the Calçada_do_Moinho of the Wind, which will give the Santana Field, where then was the bulls court on the same site where the Medical school . 
When we got aa Calçada_da_Carriche almost always passed from midnight. 
Ali expected the animals eating and drinking. 
There was descantes, laughter and his dribbles more ... 
Men and women sang, the herdsmen ran to get the animals in order and all that followed with a joy so great that you can have no idea! 
Old and dilapidated, the Praça_do_Campo_de_Santana could not meet another so that the demolition. 
She opened herself, in this way, a gap in this favorite amusement Lisbon. 
Until in 1891, was the tender the construction of the current square in the grounds of the still deserted Campo_Pequeno on the initiative of the Empresa_Tauromáquica_Lisbonense. 
The project was approved the authorship of the António_Dias_da_Silva architect with the award of the work to the French Boussard. 
Work began themselves in August 1891, with the foundation for Redondel of 36 meters in diameter and planned capacity for eight thousand people. 
A year later came the inauguration. 
in the outer coating, opted If by red brick, in Arabic style, though with four Turkish turrets. 
The riders for the opening of the square came all of the old Praça_de_Campo_de_Santana. 
This would be the first of many races celebrated gala, with special emphasis on those carried out in the visits of the king Eduardo_VII_de_Inglaterra_e_Afonso_XIII, those of the Clube_Tauromáquico, Assistência_Nacional_aos_Tuberculosos and the Casa_da_Imprensa. nan nan Brittany_Murphy-Monjack, born Brittany_Anne_Bertolotti (Atlanta, November 10, 1977?
Los_Angeles, December 20, 2009) was an actress and American singer. 
Gained notoriety graças_a his roles in films like As_Patricinhas_de_Beverly_Hills, Garota_Interrompida, Os_Garotos of the Minha_Vida, 8 Mile, Recém_Casados ​​and Sin_City. 
in the music business, he provided the vocals for the Faster_Kill_Pussycat song the musician Paul_Oakenfold, which reached the top spot in the Billboard_Hot_Dance_Club_Songs and seventh in the UK Singles_Chart in 2006 and also sang for humanitarian projects together with Avril_Lavigne singer in the Peace_Songs collection, in 2006 . 
Brittany_Anne_Bertolotti, was born in Atlanta, Georgia on November 10, 1977, daughter of Sharon_Kathleen_Murphy and Angelo_Joseph_Bertolotti. 
His parents divorced If when she was two years old, having been created by the mother in Edison, Nova_Jérsei and then Los_Angeles, California, where they moved so that Brittany could begin aa acting career. 
De_acordo with her, her mother never doubted his creativity, and considered a crucial factor in their success. 
Sharon is Jewish Ashkenazi and Angelo is Italian - American. 
Brittany was created as a Baptist, but became a Christian without institutional links later. 
the nine-year-old Brittany won a place in the Les_Misérables musical, and thirteen had his own manager. 
His first job in Hollywood came to 14 years, as in the Brenda_Drexell Drexells_Class series, which lasted only one season. 
Em_seguida interpreted Molly_Morgan in Almost_Home, spin-off The_Torkelsons. 
The series also lasted only one season. 
Em_seguida, she had appearances in several series such as Parker_Lewis_Cant_Lose, Blossom and Frasier. 
Also had recurring roles on Sister, Sister, Party of Five and Boy_Meets_World. 
In 1997 she began voicing the character Luanne_Platter (as well as the young version of Joseph_Gribble) in the animated series King of the Hill, which would be in the air for thirteen seasons. 
In 2005, Brittany received a Annie_Award for his voice acting in the 167th episode of the series, titled Girl, Youll_Be_A_Giant_Soon. 
After landing a role in the successful Clueless in 1995, Brittany would star in many box office hits such as Girl, Interrupted, 1999; 
Do not Say a Word, 2001; 
8 Mile, 2002 and Uptown_Girls, 2003. 
She also starred in some cult films, such as Spun, 2002. 
In 2004 he starred in the romantic comedy Little_Black_Book opposite Holly_Hunter, and the critically acclaimed Sin_City. 
Also starred in two films directed by Edward_Burns: 
Sidewalks of New_York (2001) and The_Groomsmen (2006). 
In 2009 he was cast as the main character Tribute, TV movie based on the novel by Nora_Roberts. 
He was listed to appear in The_Expendables, younger Sylvester_Stallone film, which was released in 2010. 
However, the representative of Stallone confirmed to MTV News that Murphy never had anything related to the film. 
Murphy completed the movie Abandoned in June 2009 and was released in 2010 after his death. 
at the end of the film, before the credits, is seen In memory of Brittany_Murphy (In Brittany_Murphy memory). 
In November 2009, Murphy left the production The_Caller, which was being filmed in Puerto_Rico, and was replaced by Rachelle_Lefevre. 
Murphy denied rumors the media that she had been fired from the project after having hard living on the set with the directors, and cited creative differences. 
Murphy's agent denied that his client was fired, saying she and the production mutually parted ways. 
She was also involved in the romantic comedy Shrinking_Charlotte and came to participate in the filming, but after his death the executive producer said Michael_Gordon is on hold while he and his producers find a way to replace Murphy and move forward with the film or not. 
The suspense Something_Wicked, his latest film, was released only in 2014 after being shot in 2009. 
On June 6, 2006, Brittany and Paul_Oakenfold released the single Faster_Kill_Pussycat, vowel contribution of it to the second album he entitled The Lively_Mind. 
The song became If successful in the US clubs, reaching the top spot in the Hot_Dance_Club_Songs stop to Billboard magazine. 
Also it reached the seventh position in the British official stop. 
She would experience sing again in the Happy_Feet film, playing Somebody to Love of the Queen and Boogie_Wonderland of the Earth, Wind & Fire. 
Murphy starred in the music video of The Little_Respect Wheatus the band, along with actor Shawn_Hatosy. 
She also appeared in the video to Here_de_Luscious_Jackson music and in the music video for the song Closest_Thing_to_Heaven the band Tears for Fears. 
at the end of 2002, Brittany began dating actor Ashton_Kutcher, who starred with her in Just_Married. 
It has been engaged to businessman Jeff_Kwatinetz and the Joe_Macaluso production assistant she met while filming Little_Black_Book. 
The engagement, however, ended in August 2006. 
In May 2007, Brittany married British screenwriter Simon_Monjack in a private Jewish ceremony. 
in the last three and a half years of his life, Murphy, Monjack and her mother lived together in the same house. 
Monjack passed away on May 23, 2010, apparently from acute pneumonia and severe anemia, have been found dead at his home in Hollywood_Hills, same place of the death of his wife. 
in early 2000, Murphy lost a lot of weight, caused o_que cocaine addiction rumors. 
Brittany participated in humanitarian projects, recording songs by renowned artists such as Avril_Lavigne in the Peace_Songs collection in 2006. 
In 2005, Murphy signed on as spokesperson for Jordache jeans. 
the 8.00 of the day December 20, 2009, the Departamento_de_Bombeiros_de_Los_Angeles responded to a call at the residence of Brittany and Monjack. 
The actress was found unconscious in the shower by her mother. 
According to this, Brittany spent the whole day in the room, going at all times to the bathroom to vomit. 
The mother also said that Brittany was thinking thinner of what purported to be, however, doubted that his death had been caused by overdose of drugs, of which the actress had addiction. 
Firefighters tried to revive -la at the site, where it was then transported to the Centro_Médico_Cedars-Sinai. 
to be brought into the hospital, he was declared dead at the 10:04 after suffering a cardiac arrest. 
The primary cause of death was pneumonia, aggravated by iron deficiency anemia. 
To Rose_McGowan, Brittany was like champagne - bright and bubbly. 
Whenever I saw, were always lots of laughter. 
Fortunately, her smile will always be preserved in the movies. 
Murphy was buried in the Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park (Hollywood_Hills) on December 24, 2009. 
On May 23, 2010, five months after the death of Brittany, her husband, Simon_Monjack, was found dead at home in Los_Angeles apparently from acute pneumonia and profound anemia. 
On January 11, 2012, he asked the Angelo_Bertolotti Tribunal_Superior of California, ask the Los_Angeles_County Office to deliver the hair samples from her daughter that was done in independent tests. 
The lawsuit was dismissed on July 19, 2012, after Bertolotti not appear at two hearings. 
A few months later, on November 18, 2013, a new report that was issued by the The_Carlson_Company laboratory hired by the father of the actress, pointed very acima_do levels the normal per menos_dez heavy metals, both in Murphy's body quanto_de her husband Monjack. 
The result indicates that both may have been poisoned. nan nan Two hours before the premiere of the Brazilian volleyball team in the Pan American, diante_dos Canadians, the Ginásio_do_Maracanãzinho was already full.
Some fans took their protest against the cutting Ricardinho of the group. 
in the result of the game, gave the rationale: 
Brazil won by 3 sets to 0, with partial 25/19, 25/18 and 25/17. 
Rezende, you're golden, but Ricardinho is the guy ?? ?? Or Ricardinho, number 17, the best player of the world, Volta, Ricardinho, Queremos_Ricardinho! and Ricardinho, love you were a few scattered phrases on banners and posters in the stands.
in the presentation of the Brazilian team a minority booed when it was announced the coach Rezende. 
The boos were soon drowned out by applause. 
But all it took was the kickoff of the match for the more than eight thousand people who packed the gym shout the name of the lifter. 
Meanwhile, Marcelo prepared -If substitute for the initial serve. 
The coach Rezende started the game with Marcelinho, André_Nascimento, Giba, Dante, Gustavo, and Rodrigão Escadinha while Canadians relied on Lewis, Munday, Duerden, Youngberg, Grapentine, Winters and libero Wolfenden. 
When Brazil won by 24-18, Rezende took André_Nascimento and Marcelinho to put Bruno Anderson and his son. 
Surprisingly, Bruno was booed. 
But in the sequence, the entire gym shouted the name of the lifter. 
in the set second, when Brazil dominated by 24-17, the coach declined to inversion. 
By the end of the game, Bruno Anderson and not entered on the court. 
Apesar_da victory, the Brazilian team could not hide that the climate does not go to the best. 
In almost all the technical charts, the bad players stared Rezende, who had to approach each athlete individually, to pass instructions. 
New captain of the selection, the tip Giba let out after the game, that really misses to the Ricardinho lifter. 
It's hard to talk about it, because the Ricardinho is my friend, said the player, who added: 
We have 14 years of experience and seven years he's my roommate. 
It is really useful, yes. nan nan In the name of God is a book written by a Catholic nun and renowned former historian of religion called Karen_Armstrong (1944-), whose most of his academic production developed after his dismissal with religiosity, tal_como itself states in other works, such as the autobiographical Ladder Spiral and Uma_História_de_Deus.
in it, the author tries to raise the origins of fundamentalism in the three major monotheistic religions: 
Christianity, Judaism and Islam. 
The approach of fundamentalism in the text Karen_Armstrong part of the passage of the nineteenth century to the twentieth, citing a series of episodes that would have been responsible for a break from the idyllic vision that was then dreamed aa time of European Belle_Époque such as the disclosure of the work Sigmund_Freud the Guerra_Franco Prussian (1870-1871) and catastrophic theories heretofore in vogue. 
For Karen, fundamentalism is not just a response to a society? Modern? 
that incited the dichotomy between mythos and logos, but the fruit also of itself. 
The same nineteenth century is pointed out by another scholar of religion, chamdo Ivo_Pedro_Oro priest, as a profound secularization period of capitalist society. 
On the one hand Max_Weber identified the Protestant ethic as a driver of capitalism, with the passing of the decades that same capitalism would have provided a cooling environment of the original fervor of Protestantism. 
This all, of course, did not dampen the clashes with the mythos described by Armstrong, for example in the case of the description given by Ivo of the origin of the revival, going back to the eighteenth century in England and in the US. 
Such practices were moments of encounter where, through technical,? People were taken to have a religious experience that led to a state of religious ecstasy and an immediate relationship with God? .
The role of the preacher was decisive. 
Usually in the middle of a densely emotional climate, he could convince the faithful from their condition as sinners, challenge them for the acceptance of salvation and lead them to an encounter with Jesus in the Espírito_Santo. 
Turning now to the text of the English writer, apesar_de start taking as its starting point the year 1492, when there were three important events for Christians, Muslims and Jews - the discovery of America, the conquest of Granada and the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, the theme? fundamentalism? begins to gain prominence a_partir_do Chapter 5, entitled? battlegrounds? ;
name that gains a double meaning dentro_da the work. 
The first certainly refers to? Powder keg? 
that Europe had become years before Primeira_Guerra_Mundial. 
Nationalism, neo-colonialism and the late unification of Germany and Italy were responsible not only for an early disappointment of European society, but also for the death of thousands of people in several battlefields. 
However, we could still point to reference the title in question to them? Battlefields? 
present in the religious field, more precisely in the dispute between mythos and logos, also presented in the opening chapters of Karen's work. 
in these clashes between science and religion, opposing groups or even factions dentro_de the same group met in the midst of a society that saw the strengthening of the scientific method eao emergence of new explanatory models for the problems plaguing mankind. 
Following a pattern that keeps most of the chapters of the book, Karen analyzes the situation between Christians, Jews and Muslims. 
in the case of Christianity, it develops the problem brought by Darwin's ideas circulating cada_vez with mais_vigor in the media, opposing the common doomsday theories until mid-XIX century and were easily inserted into explanatory models of religious nature . 
Armstrong does not get to name names of catastrophic thinkers, but can stand out If the name of the paleontologist and French naturalist George_Cuvier (1769-1832), who was one of the great supporters of this thought that believed that species were periodically? Recycled ? 
by major natural disasters, similar to the Biblical flood. 
Currently, new explanatory models of Darwinian nature imposes a_partir_do academia, such as gradualism and punctuated equilibrium, drawing If the entire scientific framework produced post - Darwin. 
Mais_uma_vez curiously or not, in both cases the main representatives of these theories have a common element, in this time not the ecclesiastical bond, but rather, both are (or were, in the case of Stephen_Jay) science communicators and? defenders? 
of atheism. 
in the case of the gradualist theory, his main defender is a biologist and great promoter of atheism Richard_Dawkins (1941-), author of? God? Delusion? Which states that evolution occurs through the accumulation of small changes over several generations.
Already punctuated equilibrium, por_sua_vez, presents itself as a scientific theory originally formulated in 1972 by paleontologists Stephen_Jay_Gould_ (1941-2002) and Niles_Eldredge (1943-), according a_qual the evolution of the species does not occur steadily, but alternating long periods of little change with rapid transformative jumps. 
Turning to the case of the Jews, Karen looks at the internal differences of Zionism itself, already in the nineteenth century, and its development will culminate in the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, shortly after the end of the Segunda_Guerra_Mundial and already in the case of Muslims, many cases of rapprochement with Western culture face a barrier a_partir_de Jamal al - Din al - Afghani (1838-1897). 
Jamal Al-Din was a promoter of ideals pan - Islamists in the Arab world and notorious critic Syed_Ahmad_ (1817-1898), pro-British leader. 
Jamal al - Din had a romantic view of the history of the Arab people and marked by a deep thought anti - Enlightenment, denying the ideas of Jean_Jacques_Rousseau and François_Voltaire, por_exemplo. 
Similarly aa notion Kräfte, term of Germanic origin that refers aa idea of ​​strength, Afghani develops the romantic idea of ​​a nation that is able to maintain its unity / identity through intrinsic forces that are capable, por_sua_vez, to keep -la cohesive and homogeneous. 
Later, his ideas were taken up by Ayatollah Khomeini during the Islamic revolution of 1979 in Iran. 
Por_fim, one may highlight some criticisms that can be applied to the two works. 
in the case of Karen_Armstrong, it is not uncommon to find on the Internet pointing a certain texts? rancor? of the author in relation to Christianity, since she was a nun for much of the 1960s.
And it would be aa wonder she would not have received after the publication of his work, an honorary title of the Associação_Muçulmana_de_Ciências_Sociais and lecione in the Leo_Baeck_College, a school dedicated aa training rabbis. 
Speculation aa part, remains critical pointed during the lessons of the course, in which Karen would have disregarded the mythologizing process of scientific knowledge itself (logos). nan nan Itaú, the second largest private bank in the country, achieved net profit of R $ 4.016 billion in the first half of this year, surpassing rival Bradesco and recording the highest profit among private banks in the past 20 years.
on Monday, Bradesco had announced R $ 4.007 billion profit in the period. 
Compared to the revenue in the first six months of 2006, R $ 2.958 billion, net income of Itaú grew 36% this year. 
in the second quarter, the financial institution had a net income of R $ 2.115 billion, compared to R $ 1.498 billion in the same period of the previous year. 
The high, 41.2%, was driven by sales of assets and growth of the loan portfolio. 
This result includes among other non-recurring sales of the shareholding of the bank in the credit information company Serasa and the headquarters of BankBoston in São_Paulo and provision for excess loan losses to the minimum required in the form allow the absorption of possible increases in default arising from a strong reversal of the economic cycle in stressful situations, said Itaú. 
in total, the non-recurring effects totaled R $ 196 million. 
Recurring net income for the period was R $ 1.919 billion, compared to R $ 1.477 billion in the second quarter of 2006. 
Em_relação_aos the first three months of the year the recurring income of the institution increased 0.9%. 
The loan portfolio of Itaú, including endorsements and sureties, jumped from R $ 74.8 billion in June 2006 to R $ 104.8 billion at the end of the second quarter of this year, a jump of 40.2%. 
in comparison with the first three months of this year, the portfolio grew by 3.7%. 
The performance of the portfolio was driven by vehicle financing, which grew 58.6% in the period, and credit for micro, small and medium enterprises, which advanced 59.7%. 
The return on average equity stood at 32.8% annualized, down from 35.1% a year ago. 
If considered public and private banks, the highest profit in January-June of the last 20 years belong to the Bank of Brazil, which in 2006 reported revenues of R $ 4.032 billion (amount adjusted by the IPCA until June 30, 2007). nan nan The regional superintendent of the Polícia_Federal_de_Rondônia, Joaquim_Mesquita delegate, said in Friday, day 04, 23 people have been arrested so far, for the Operação_Dominó in Rondônia.
The gang is accused of practicing various administrative offenses such as embezzlement of public funds, corruption, malfeasance, graft, embezzlement, extortion, money laundering and selling of judicial sentences. 
Among those arrested are the president of the Tribunal_de_Justiça_de_Rondônia, Judge Sebastião_Teixeira_Chaves, President of the Assembléia_Legislativa of the state, deputy José_Carlos_de_Oliveira (PL), the Carlão ?? ?? , Accused of leading of the scam, former Attorney General of Justice, Abdiel_Ramos_Figueira, the vice president of the Tribunal_de_Contas_de_Rondônia, Edílson_de_Sousa_Silva, além_de other judges, judges, prosecutors and nine state legislators.
De_acordo with Polícia_Federal, the arrests took place without resistance. 
The operation also served 60 search warrants. 
Mais_de 300 federal police to the Amazon, Distrito_Federal, Mato_Grosso, Acre and Rondônia participated in the searches and arrests. 
According disclosed by the Federal Police, the criminal group shifted since 2004 about R $ 70 million of the public coffers, through the payment of services, shopping and overpriced works. 
?? This research demonstrates the existence of a large criminal organization in the state of Rondônia, which began in the Assembléia_Legislativa and extended its tentacles ?? ?? for part of the powers of the state, committing and involving people from the Tribunal_de_Justiça of the Tribunal_de_Contas of the Ministério_Público and the Poder_Executivo ?? Summarized Mosque.
The delegate reported that people who were arrested by warrant issued by the Superior_Tribunal_de_Justiça (STJ), ou_seja, members of the top brass of the government of Rondônia, will be transferred to Superintendência_da_Polícia_Federal in Brasilia. nan nan In physics and engineering, mechanical strain is called the value of the distribution of forces per unit area around a material point dentro_de a material body or solid medium.
in the mechanics of continuous media, tension is a measure of the intensity of the internal forces acting between the particles to an imaginary cross section of a body of deformable material. 
These internal forces are reaction forces against the external forces applied to the body. 
External forces are either surface forces or field forces. 
As the loaded deformable body is admitted as a solid, the internal forces are distributed continuously by dentro_do the volume of the material body, ou_seja, the stress distribution is expressed as a continuous function of spatial and temporal coordinates. 
The SI unit for pressure is the pascal (Pa symbol), which is a measure of force per unit area. 
The drive voltage is the same as that of the pressure. 
engineering quantities are often measured in megapascals (MPa) or gigapascals (GPa). 
In English units, tension is expressed in pounds-force per square inch (psi) or force-kilopounds per square inch (ksi). 
A particular case is the uniaxial tension, which is defined in a situation which applies the force F uniformly distributed over an area A. 
in this case the uniaxial mechanical stress is represented by a scalar designated with the Greek letter? 
(Sigma) and is given by:. 
Since the units (Pa) (= Pascal (N / m)) (MPa) = 10 (Pa) or (MPa) = (N / mm²). 
The above situation can extend themselves to more complicated situations forces are not uniformly distributed in the interior of a complex geometry mais_ou_menos body. 
in this case the mechanical stress can not be represented by a scalar. 
It is considered a body subjected to tension and realize a cut by an imaginary plane? 
the split in two, each point on the cutting plane can be defined voltage vector T that depends on the internal state of the tension body, the coordinates of the selected point and the unit normal vector is not plane? .
in this case one can prove that ten are related by a linear transformation T or tensor field called tensor tension:. 
It is analogous to the pressure elementary phenomenon that occurs in fluids, including using the same unit, considering not only forces perpendicular to the plane or section considered but also oblique and tangential forces to the plan or section, the solid is able to support. 
Tensions classify themselves as traction, compression (normal voltage) or shear (shear or tangential). 
The bending stress or Momento_Fletor is a particular case of tensile and compressive acting together in the same section, causing predominant strains in the opposing faces of the body or structure and smaller deformations and consequent stresses in the central part if blanking in the shaft inertia. 
The set of zero voltage points on the inside of the glass is called the neutral line. 
in the torque prevails angular shear stress, and as the bending causes greater deformation and consequent stresses in the faces or outer edges of the piece, body or structure, is reduced in the central part where the deformations are smaller, if canceling inertia in the center where there is no deformation. 
Whole Body requested by a force or the resultant of a set of any forces deforms generating voltage (s) inside. 
Tensions operate in two different regimes: 
in the elastic range or the plastic regime. 
lower limit voltages that particular characteristic of each material called elastic limit of the material, operating in the elastic regime, causing elastic deformations in the body back to the original dimensions when the force ceased. 
The range of tensions in the elastic regime may be higher or lower, and a resistance characteristic of the known elastic materials. 
Stresses in this scheme work in the range of proportionality where the deformations are proportional to the tensions. 
Voltages higher than the yield stress cause the plastic regime where they cause permanent deformation when the request terminated. 
in this scheme there is large deformation with constant voltage or with little variation. 
The range of stresses in the plastic regime may be higher or lower, one of the strength characteristics of the material called ductility. 
extreme voltage greater than the characteristic value determined for each material, called the breaking point, will cause collapse or breakage of the body part or structure that is characterized by the breakdown of the parts that compose it. 
In engineering the strain on the structural metal such as carbon steel and aluminum in the operating system are called plastic yield stresses lead to a state where the molecules are reorganized, absorbing and re - distributing efforts. 
This voltage varies little over a relatively long period of permanent deformation. 
reinforced concrete structures as well dimensioned are designed to work on this scheme to be submitted to critical requests. 
There is consensus that must be deformed excessively by steel flow (sub-armed structure) revealing the overhead before final collapse and inadvertent collapse by fragmentation and crumbling of concrete (super-armed structure). 
Temperature conditions alter the crystal structure of the substance influencing the stiffness or ability to withstand tensions. 
In specific sections or planes of the material or when the voltage does not vary with the sections considered is studied by graphic called stress-strain diagram where tensions are recorded on the ordinates and the deformations on the abscissae. 
The slope of the resulting line on the elastic scheme configures Módulo_de_Elasticidade the material, which then is nothing more than the deformation suffered by the supported unit and absorbed power. 
The modulus of elasticity, represented by the letter E is then the stiffness of the material, other measures their resistance. 
In various parallel sections the study is done through Momento_Fletor M diagrams, shear force diagram? and normal force diagram? Where the horizontal axis represents the analyzed sections and the vertically acting force that is equal to the resistant strains according to Newton's third law, also called the law of action and reaction.
The basic principle is that if the applicants forces (loads and own weight) and the resistant forces (tensions) in a plane any of the structure were not the same, the body would be moving. 
These graphs mainly denote the maximum stresses and their requested data sections that are essential for calculation and design of the structure. 
In further studies using -if the Círculo_de_Mohr to calculate the stresses acting on each inner plane tilt of any section named. 
The materials generally withstand very well the compressive stress less aa shear stress and AA are low tensile stress resistance. 
For an idea of ​​the vast difference in resistance note If the material of the core of the planets supports the weight of the entire star absorbing compressive stresses only. 
The compression stress caused by forces acting along a single axis cause differential deformations that generate other internal stresses causing disruption by shear or tensile stress. 
The drive voltage is force per unit area. 
in the Sistema_Internacional_de_Unidades is the pascal also pressure unit. 
1 Pa = 1 N / m2 (square meter newton_por). 
1 Pa = 0.1 kgf / m2 (0.10197 kilogram-force per square meter). 
in the study of the resistance of the materials usual units are MPa (megapascal) and Kgf / cm2 (kilogram-force per square centimeter). nan nan The main floor of the Aeroporto_Internacional_de_São_Paulo (Cumbica) in Guarulhos, will be completely renovated in March 2008, according to information from the Ministério_da_Defesa announced on Monday, 6.
Thus, the emergency reform that would begin em_breve, was discarded. 
The Minister of Defense, Nelson_Jobim, announced the reform, according to studies by the Empresa_Brasileira_de_Infra-Estrutura_Aeroportuária (Infraero), the reform can be done without the track is forbidden. 
Apesar_da the setting, the timing of the work was not disclosed. 
De_acordo with information from the Defense, the first stage of the reform will be the reform of one-third of the track in one of the headwaters. 
With this, the other two parts are available for takeoffs and landings. 
in the second part, the other night will be reformed, and the third stage, the center of the runway will be renovated. 
in the third part of the reform, part of the Cumbica flights will be transferred to the Aeroporto_de_Viracopos in Campinas. nan nan Leonora_Evelina_Simonds or Leonora_Piper (Boston 1859 - July 30, of 1950) was one of the most notorious mediums in the history of spiritualism and parapsychology.
It was probably the most studied personality medium and one of the most validated by scientists, have been thoroughly investigated in life for almost 25 years. 
Thousands of pages were published with reports of their sessions and analyzes carried out by a variety of renowned researchers, most notably William_James and Richard_Hodgson. 
The Amy_Tanner psychologist published in 1910 a book that describes the seances that performed with Piper, concluding that the alleged figures were fictitious creations of your own mind and not disembodied spirits. 
in the However, the study was criticized by Tanner Eleanor_Sidgwick (see:

The childhood and youth Leonora_Piper were normal in every way. 
It was the fourth of six children and was a leader in the games and sports. 
in adolescence, she learned to sew. 
It has always been a good student. 
Leonora's parents were deeply religious, members of the Igreja_Congregacional. 
Leonora kept themselves in this religion until the year 1910 when, during a visit to the England, was baptized in the Church of England. 
His father died in consequence of injuries sustained in the Guerra_Civil_Americana, and his mother died of pneumonia, 88 years, in 1925. 
to the 22 years he married themselves with Wiiliam_Piper in Boston. 
Three years later he was born the eldest Alta and some time later the daughter Minerva. 
In this time it was described as a tall person, slender, with a grace and dignity difficult to describe, of Greek feature and golden curls of hair, carrier Mid culture. 
The family never made any objection to the psychic activities of the Piper lady. 
The husband has always been very interested in the phenomena caused by it. 
The daughter Alta, while recognizing that they were deprived of many precious hours of the mother company, recalls was found that apesar_de all appointments had a daily ritual that Leonora_Piper never failed to accomplish that was to make good night's prayer, kissing the daughters and saying Them: 
God bless you, dear, before handing -Las to the care of a housekeeper. 
Piper High transpires their mother admiration and says that since childhood asked God do -la like Mom when she grew up. 
to 8 years of age, while playing in the garden of his house, Leonora felt a sharp noise in his right ear, accompanied by a long, hissing sound, then listening to the words: 
Tia_Sara did not die, but you remain. 
Startled, then went to his mother about the incident, which sought to distract -la. 
Days later, the family received a letter from a very distant place, saying that Aunt Sara (sister Leonora's mother) had died suddenly at the same time and day when the fact occurred. 
Years later, as an adult, she married Leonora If and moved to the city of Beacon_Hill. 
He suffered a sleigh accident, and some years later his daughter is born Alta. 
Leonora heard of a clairvoyant, Mr. Cocke, who would be calling the attention of many in the city, giving correct medical diagnosis and performing cures. 
in the June 19, 1884, Leonora went to see a clairvoyant, accompanied by her father, a_partir_de a hint of her husband to try to cure the effects that there had been sledding accident left. 
During the first visit, but Mrs. Piper reported that during the time he was listening to his diagnosis, for a moment felt was found that was far from the place, then going to a state of unconsciousness. 
Days after the incident, he returned again to the local junto_de his father in law. 
If all sat em_torno_do the clairvoyant, so that each one put his hands on the head each other. 
When the clairvoyant laid hands on Leonora, he claimed that he saw a light which appeared strange faces. 
She then left the chair, picked up a pencil, went to a table and quickly wrote a message he delivered to Mr. Juiz_Frost, who lived in Cambridge. 
This then said: 
Lady, I'm spiritualist mais_de 30 years ago, but the message you gave me is the most important I have ever received. 
She encouraged me to go ahead, I know now that my boy lives. 
Years earlier, Mr. Frost had lost his son in the tragic accident. 
Before he died, his son became unconscious several months and no longer recognized his parents. 
in the message, however, he said that his mind was as clear as ever, recognized him as a father and gave other details, o_que to Frost was irrefutable evidence. 
Piper soon became known as an eminent medium and began to be studied by parapsychological US and British organizations. 
The scientist of the Universidade_de_Harvard_William_James was the first to systematically investigate the mediumship Piper and was soon convinced that she held paranormal acts. 
After ten years of research, James set his belief in Piper in a reflection famous: 
If you want to question the law that all crows are black, you do not need to show that no crow is; 
it is enough if you prove one single crow to be white. 
My own white crow is Mrs.. 
Piper. 
throughout his research, James considered the following hypotheses about it: 
First, the possibility of fraud, o_que he rejected after years of careful observations; 
Second, an extension of the theory of subliminal Piper mind, would o_que accepting a reservoir mundane information expressed only through trances; 
Third, the hypothesis of telepathy, which also considered insufficient for some cases; and fourth, the hypothesis of the spirit, which he recognized as not only the most natural, but the simplest although not supported by conclusive evidence.
After initial studies of James, his friend and lawyer parapsychologist Richard_Hodgson considered expert in exposing fraud, took the lead of the investigation into Piper. 
Hodgson came to hire detectives to follow the medium, and after years of studies she stated that the interconnecting were at menos_em many cases o_que they claimed to be, isto_é, the surviving spirits of previously incarnated humans. 
Leonora Piper died at his home on July 3, 1950, by a bronchopneumonia. 
She was buried in the Mount_Pleasant_Cemetery in Massachusetts. nan nan The CÃ ¢ mara discusses the PSDB authoring application for postponement of the £ discussÃ the proposal extending the CPMF.

According to the expert retired from the Departamento_de_Segurança_de_Vôo, Roberto_Peterka even with problems in the reverse, the aircraft had landed quietly. 
As the largest track, the pilot would not have to lash out, if indeed that's what he did, and would have more room for the slowdown, explains. 
. 
De_acordo with Peterka, the fact Congonhas have a clue does not mean a direct cause for the accident. 
This does not mean that the Congonhas airport had a decisive influence on the accident, he concludes. 
. 
The expert also said that the reverse, pointed out as a possible cause, can not be considered the villain of the accident. 
The reverse is an auxiliary instrument in time to stop the plane, but is not considered important factor for landing, so even not working, it could have brecado the aircraft smoothly, he says. 
. 
The day before the accident, on Monday, 16, the plane would have also presented problems to land at Congonhas during the flight 3215, coming from Belo_Horizonte (Confins), only managing to stop very close to the end of the runway. 
The pilot had reported aa control tower that the track was very slippery. nan nan quantum vacuum would be the space in which there is apparently nothing to any observer, but it contains a minimal amount of energy, electromagnetic and gravitational fields and mainly virtual particles (force particles) interacting with each other.
Before, it was thought that there was a physical entity called absolute vacuum on which several scientists from the Idade_Média, including Blaise_Pascal, conducted several experiments to try to reaffirm this idea. 
The absolute vacuum would be one in which there would be nothing, chemical nem_elementos, fields and force particles, etc. 
However, it was found that if such Vácuo_Absoluto really existed, it would contradict the famous Princípio_da_Incerteza_de_Werner_Heisenberg, the postulate and larger base of the Mecânica_Quântica. 
Quantum mechanics in general and simplest way is the physical odds, in which there is no certainty quanto_a position and velocity of a particle, but a measure of probability to find the particle at a given position and in a given speed. 
The Princípio_da_Incerteza of physical Werner_Heisenberg mathematically emphasizes this idea, in which it is impossible to determine simultaneously with infinite accuracy the position and velocity of a particle. 
The more precisely determines itself to position itself to determine less speed, and vice - versa. 
This is because when you need If determine the position and velocity of a particle, we need to focus light on it. 
This light has a particular frequency and therefore a given energy. 
With this, and / or velocity of a particle position are changed according to the frequency and energy of the light used to observe -Las. 
So that the more determined If something more indeterminate If the other and vice - versa. 
It depends on the frequency and energy of the light used for observation. 
If the absolute vacuum really existed, it would run counter the Princípio_da_Incerteza of Werner_Heisenberg. 
This is because the electromagnetic fields and gravitational would be zero, o_que is to say that the position and velocity of a particle would be zero. 
Ou_seja, both would be determined, contrary to the assumption of the Princípio_da_Incerteza. 
unlike what is commonly understood, the vacuum is full of potential particle pairs of matter and antimatter virtual, that are constantly being created and destroyed. 
They do not exist as observable entities, but exert pressure on other particles (Efeito_Casimir). 
The creation of virtual pairs of particles does not violate the law of conservation of mass / energy because they exist in very small time intervals much smaller than the Planck time (10 ^ -43s), so as not to cause impact on the macroscopic laws. 
The quantum vacuum is the lowest energy state known in the universe (as opposed to what would be the Absolute Zero). 
All visible matter is composed of atoms called particle systems - do_grego indivisible. 
These atoms have a nucleus of protons and neutrons, which in turn are also formed by other two particles - the quark Quark Up and Down quark. 
A quark has electric charge 2/3 and one down quark charge -1/3. 
As the proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark, if we add the electric charges of the same, this will result exactly your electric charge: 
2/3 + 2/3 - 1/3 = +1 - electric charge of the proton. 
The same applies to the neutron, which consists of an up quark and two down quarks: 
2/3 - 1/3 - 1/3 = 0 - so the electric charge of the neutron is zero. 
This core is surrounded by other elementary particles are por_sua_vez and therefore do not have the composition and can not be divided - electrons - which have electric charge of -1. 
If the atom were the size of the Estádio_de_Futebol_do_Maracanã, its nucleus would be the size of a marble and its electrons would be dust particles. 
Except that all this remaining space is not completely empty, but occupied by gravitational and electromagnetic fields, ou_seja by small vacuum energy of quantum fluctuations. 
Conforme_The_Weight_of_the_World_Is_Quantum_Chromodynamics the particles which form the nucleus of the atom (quarks and gluons which together hold) are due to fluctuations of the quantum vacuum ou_seja matter is virtual and is formed by power fluctuations of the quantum vacuum. 
The case of forming a star, the Sun for example, serves to understand the emergence of a black hole. 
There are about five billion years, a cloud of rotating gas containing hydrogen in its composition, started to gravitationally contract -If due to the presence of large mass. 
She contracted If more and more until they arrived at a point where the hydrogen began to fuse If in itself, burning it and releasing energy and radiation. 
That energy began to balance the gravitational attraction. 
Ou_seja on the one hand the positive pressure being exerted by gravity balanced by the other side by the negative pressure, and radiation energy released by the fusion of hydrogen; 
It is precisely the nuclear fusion of hydrogen that makes a star shine. 
in the extent to which the hydrogen is burned, it will eventually and will beginning to appear helium, among other elements. 
Nosso_Sol has enough hydrogen to live another five and a half billion years. 
at the end of the life of a star, its nuclear fuel (hydrogen) reaches almost to the end, and then there is the burning of the remaining hydrogen and, for stars with mass up to 8 suns, whose end is to turn a white dwarf star, like the end of our sun. 
As for stars more massive than eight solar masses, their destiny is to become a black hole. 
The star begins to contract If more and more, their light rays are becoming cada_vez_mais bent by the gravitational pull that increases per year as the star contracts. 
Finally, the star stabilize themselves in a final state with very strong gravity, in which no light can escape, ou_seja, stabilizes the star themselves in a black hole. 
If nothing can exceed the speed of light, de_acordo with Relatividade_Restrita, nothing can escape from the gravity of a black hole. 
The area in which nothing can come out of a black hole is called the event horizon. 
Physical Jacob_Bekenstein, proposed the idea that the area of ​​the event horizon would be a measure of the entropy of a black hole, however, been found that if the event horizon of a black hole was indeed a measure of entropy; he should have a temperature and thus emit radiation, something impossible for a black hole, since everything that enters can not leave. 
However, it was found that there was a possibility that the event horizon is a measure of the entropy of a black hole, not even need If directly emit a certain radiation. 
As there is no absolute vacuum, then there are several antiparticle pairs of particles with both virtual interacting entre_si em_torno_de a black hole in which the positive energy of a particle cancels the negative power to the other, and vice - versa. 
The negative energy particle would be attracted to the very strong gravity of the black hole and fall dentro_dele it, releasing its positive energy partner to the outside space. 
The negative energy particle dentro_do decrease the black hole of its mass, since it would cancel part of the positive energy of the mass of the black hole. 
The positive energy released particle seem that as emitted by the black hole, to a distant observer in the space. 
Ou_seja, positive energy particle would not come directly from the black hole, as thought by the outside observer, but from outer space himself. 
in this way, the idea Vácuo_Quântico solves this problem by assuming that the event horizon is a measure of the entropy of a black hole. 
The radiation from a Buraco_Negro is called Hawking radiation, named after the English physicist Stephen_William_Hawking, which theoretically demonstrated how such bodies emit certain radiation. 
We can conclude that there is no absolute vacuum, but a minimum energy state, the ground state in which there are pairs of virtual particles (force-carrying particles like the graviton, por_exemplo, which measured the gravitational force) entre_si interacting. nan nan Brazilians who are in Cancun, one of the most visited tourist spots in Mexico are preparing for the arrival of the hurricane?

The crash triggered the most devastating economic crisis in the history of the United_States, considering themselves to scope and duration of its effects. 
Marks the beginning of 12 years of the Grande_Depressão, which affected all industrialized Western countries. 
After Primeira_Guerra_Mundial, the countries of Europe lay in ruins, while United_States had great prosperity, por_causa_da the production and export of large quantities during the war. 
With the increase in production, United_States, during the 20s, had enough growth and prosperity to dominate other markets such as in the América_Latina. 
It was called Loucos_Anos_20. 
The consumption had increased, the industry created all the time consumer goods, clubs and clubs lived full and movies made -If great fun. 
With this prosperity, the shares were valued. 
In September 1929, the Dow_Jones index, which measures the market, recorded the maximum peak and the market began to feel that a fall could approach. 
Thus, the volume of business had declined until the situation become untenable. 
He began the 1929 crisis. 
The shareholders put their shares to sale and there were few buyers, prices of shares fell. 
For lack of resources, companies demitiam its employees, who were without jobs. 
Faliam banks and factories and the effects of the crisis spread to the world. 
The crisis occurred, por_causa_da breaking the bag and also for two other reasons:. 
on the 24th of October 1929, which became known as Feira_Negra Thursday, the crash occurred (break) of the Nova_York Stock Exchange. 
on that day, stocks lost 11% of its value in very strong negotiations. 
Several bankers leaders of the Wall_Street met to find a solution to the panic and chaos in the trading session. 
The meeting included Thomas_Lamont, acting head of the Morgan_Bank, Albert_Wiggin, head of the Chase_National_Bank and Charles_E._Mitchell, president of the National_City_Bank_of_New_York. 
They chose Richard_Whitney, vice president of the Exchange, to act on their behalf. 
With bankers and financial resources, Whitney placed a bid of a large block of shares in the US 
Steel at a price well acima_do the market and many stock investors would quickly sell their shares. 
6091870 financials were quickly sold on the same day, making -if the third largest turnover of the story of the bag. 
This break has made companies and banks were bankrupt and the value of the bags fell greatly from one day to the next. 
This fall reflected in most of the capitalist countries. 
Many people lost their jobs, there was panic among people, leading some to suicide, including 11 of the bag speculators. 
The increased unemployment, American industrial production was reduced to 54%. 
The market lost more than $ 30 billion in two days. 
The market continued to fall, reaching a historical negative number on November 13, 1929, to 198.60. 
The market recovered for several months, reaching a peak of secondary closing 294.07 on April 17, 1930, before embarking on another negative peak in the But this was stronger when the Dow closed at 41.22 , the lowest of the 20th century. 
It would not recover from September 1929 to November 1954. 
The financial crash followed a speculative who took over in the late 1920s, it took hundreds of Americans to invest heavily in the stock market. 
A significant number of them was to borrow money to buy more stock. 
In August 1929, brokers were small loans to investors who were buying shares. 
More than 8.5 billion dollars have been lent, over which half of all the money in circulation in the United_States in the season. 
The prices of the shares were rising and encouraging more people to invest, people expected that the prices of the shares would rise further. 
Speculation fueled rise further and created an economic bubble. 
In 1932, the Comissão_Pecora was established by the Senate of the United_States, to study the causes of the accident. 
in the following year, Congress of the United_States approved the Lei_Glass-Steagall, which became compulsory a separation between commercial banks, which take deposits and give loans to investment banks, which issue and distribute stocks, bonds and others. 
After the fall of the stock market, stock markets around the world instituted measures to suspend trading in the event of rapid declines, claiming that the measures would prevent panic. 
in the Yet another accident happened, being known as second-Feira_Negra of October 19, 1987, when the Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average fell 22.6%, was the worst drop since 1929. 
Economists and historians disagree about the role that the crash had on economic, social and subsequent political events. 
The_Economist argued in a 1998 article that depression did not start with the crash of the stock market. 
It was unclear the time of the accident that a depression was beginning. 
They asked : 
You can collapse very serious Bourse produce a serious setback for the industry when industrial production is mostly in a healthy and balanced condition? 
They argued that there must be some setback, but still there was insufficient evidence to prove that it will be long or that he needs to go the length of producing general industrial depression. 
Mas_The_Economist also warned that some bank failures are also expected and some banks may not have reserves to finance commercial and industrial enterprises. 
They concluded that the position of the banks is the key to the situation, but what would happen could not have been predicted. 
Academics see the Crash_de_Wall_Street 1929 as part of a historical process that has been a part of the new boom and bust theories. 
De_acordo with economists like Joseph_Schumpeter, Nikolai_Kondratiev and Charles_E._Mitchell, the accident was merely a historical event in the ongoing process known as economic cycles. 
The impact of the accident was just to increase the speed at which the cycle continued to its next level. 
Milton_Friedman in Uma_História_Monetária of the United_States (A Monetary_History of the united_states), co-written with Anna_Schwartz advances the argument that what made the great contraction so severe was not the deceleration of the economic cycle, was protectionism, or crash 1929 stock market itself? 
but, according to Friedman, o_que plunged the country into a deep depression was the collapse of the banking system for three waves of panic during the period 1930-33. nan nan The Senate Conselho_de_Ética will decide in the next week on the request of the leader of the P-SOL, José_Nery (PA), to gather into one the representations made against the President of the House, Renan_Calheiros (PMDB-AL ).
The president of the council, Leomar_Quintanilha (PMDB-TO), said he is against the union representations, but that will put the proposal to a vote. 
- Ainda_que the object is the same - the loss of mandate - each representation has a nature. 
I am against because the joint may confuse the issues - he said. 
For Senator José_Nery, the union of the representations demonstrates robustness and convincing evidence to show, in our assessment, that there was breach of decorum parlanmentar. 
He said the example of what happened to the first representation, the ideal is to be created a committee of three rapporteurs to examine other processes together. 
on Thursday, Mesa_Diretora of the Senate meets the 14 hours to decide whether to accept the fourth complaint against the President of the House. 
The petition calls the investigation of complaint that Renan would coordinate a scheme to raise funds from ministries led by the PMDB. nan nan The Polícia_Federal set off in the morning of this Friday in Rondônia, the Operação_Dominó intended to arrest a gang of senior civil servants specialized misuse of public funds, corruption, embezzlement, extortion, money laundering and selling of judicial sentences.
Among the targets of the operation are the president of the Tribunal_de_Justiça of the state, Judge Sebastião_Teixeira_Chaves, and his wife, Marilda_Shirley_de_Souza_Leira_Teixeira_Chaves lawyer. 
Are getting under arrest, also the president of the Assembléia_Legislativa_de_Rondônia, deputy José_Carlos_de_Oliveira (PL), Carlão, accused of being the leader of the gang, além_de judges, other judges, prosecutors, and the least nine state legislators. 
The group is accused of prejudicing the public coffers by about R $ 70 million since 2004. 
One of its major crimes was the falsification of ghost workers payments for oranges in the Assembléia_Legislativa. 
of the 24 state representatives, 23 practiced this crime and, according to PF, diverted over R $ 10 million with this practice, in just one year. 
Among the oranges were family, friends and employees of the parliamentarians. 
in most of the times, the money raised was for parliamentarians own accounts, which were also caught in recorded video tapes for the Ivo_Cassol governor (former PSDB and currently in PPS) where he was blackmailed to pay monthly allowance of to $ 50,000 for each of the parliamentarians involved in exchange for support of subjects of interest to the local government in the Assembléia_Legislativa. 
The same lawmakers did, too, a collusion with the Ministério_Público and the Justice of the State of Rondonia. 
By the agreement, the court freed the parliamentary proceedings opened against them by the police and in return, the Assembly approved salary increases for prosecutors and judges in percentage acima_dos very tolerable by the Lei_de_Responsabilidade_Fiscal. 
Fraud involving also the overpricing of contracts with suppliers of the Assembly, além_de a real spree with airline tickets distributed widely among parliamentarians, their families and friends. 
Since July 2005 to date, there have been telephone intercepts with authorization to Justiça_Federal to monitor the steps of the gang, in which they are involved, too, Tribunal_de_Contas counselors of the state. 
Research shows that the organization has great influence in Rondônia, hindering the smooth functioning of the powers. 
The PF has opened a new front of action to investigate the case in order to determine the participation of judges and advisors of the Tribunal_de_Contas in the gang. 
The PF reported that cerca_de 300 federal police to the Amazon, Distrito_Federal, Mato_Grosso, Acre and Rondonia are part of the investigations of the Operação_Dominó. nan nan The Banat of Timisoara, (German Temeswarer_Banat in Banatul_Timi Romanian? oarei in Serbian Latin Tami?

Found themselves in the region of the Banat, was named by pelo_que asim this province. 
The province was abolished in 1778 and administratively incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary of the Habsburgs. 
Before being the province of the Habsburgs, existed in the region an Ottoman province called Vilaiato of Timisoara. 
In 1683, the failure of the second Turkish siege of Vienna marks the beginning of the end of the Ottoman Empire. 
After the Austro-Ottoman war (? 1683 1697), by the Tratado_de_Karlowitz (1699), the Imperador_da_Áustria retained their Acquisitions: 
the Vilaiato of Timisoara, west of Wallachia (Oltenia) and an extensive territory in aa around Belgrade (approximately half of Serbia), which were confirmed by the treaty that definitively ended aa war, Tratado_de_Passarowitz (1718 ). 
The Tratado_de_Karlowitz marked the beginning of the Ottoman weakness in the Europa_Oriental and the height of the Império_Habsburgo, power in the south-east of Europe. 
But the Sucessão_Espanhola War and the Independência_Húngara War (1703-1711) in the Kingdom of Hungary, led to the Habsburgs to focus their attention elsewhere, so that even in the year 1710 brought not get any territory of the Ottomans. 
Some areas of the Vilaiato of Timisoara were built by the Habsburg Austria, but the Banat remained under Ottoman administration. 
In 1716 the prince Eugénio_de_Savoia culminates the conquest of the whole Banat to Austria. 
And in 1718 the Emperor Carlos_VI (Carlos_de_Austria the Archduke of the War of the Spanish Succession) takes the reins of the Banat, which now -If called Banat of Timisoara, converting themselves in a province of the monarchy of the Habsburgs, sometida military administration until 1751, when the Empress Maria_Teresa introziu civil administration. 
The southern part of the integrated Banato remained in the Fronteira_Militar (Krajina to the Banato) until military boundaries were removed en 1871. 
During the Ottoman rule some parts of the Banat region at the foot of the frontier between Romanians and Serbs, had very low population density, after many years of war and also due to a large part of the area were forests and marshes almost uninhabited . 
in the following decades, the Austrian authorities repopulate the region: 
among others, it install themselves in groups of germanofalantes Catholic coming from different regions in Germany and Austria (later known as suabos). 
The Austrian authorities also founded Nova_Barcelona, ​​failed disenhada colony for exiles went to the War of the Spanish Succession). 
Count Claudio_Mercy (1666? 1734), who was appointed governor of the Banat of Timisoara in 1720, took numerous measures for its regeneration. 
If they dried out marshes of the Danube and the Tisza, built -If paths and canals, employing If large amounts of manpower, and impelled themselves to agriculture and trade, o_que attracted many peasants and German craftsmen who settled the District . 
The Maria_Teresa empress also showed great interest in the Banat; 
colonized the region with German peasants, encouraged the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country and developed many of the initiatives of the Count Mercy. 
The alemaães came from Swabia, Alsace and Bavaria, also of Austria, for which many colonies in the Banato_Oriental were inhabited in its majority by Germans, who were known as the suabos of the Danube or Donauschwaben. 
There was also a minority of French-speaking, settlers arrived from descendants of Lorraine, who kept the French language for generations and developed a specific ethnic identity, which was later labeled as Banat French or the French from the Banat. 
In 1799, the Banat is included in the kingdom of Hungary and, except in the period from 1848 to 1860, goes like this until the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
A_partir_do the Ausgleich of 1867 to suaba community of the Banat survives aa Magyarization policy of the Hungarian authorities, which is noticeable in the most famous name of the Suabo of the Banat of all time, János_Weißmüller_ (1904-1984), known as Johnny_Weissmüller , North American swimmer, best known as the actor who played Tarzan en several films. 
As mentioned, the province had to be repopulated after the conquest of the Habsburgs. 
Its population density was among the lowest in Europe: 
some researchers estimate that was surroundings of 1 hab ./km. 
According to the first census taken by the military authorities of the Habsburgs, the settlement of the Banat amounted to about 20 000 inhabitants in the mostly Serbs. 
The old Islamic village had left the area after the conquest of the Habsburgs. 
Low population density gave way, as we have seen, a colonization that continued until the beginning of the nineteenth century, and had many origins, German families who came from German lands and Austrian (the Donauschwaben or suabos of the Danube), and also in the south, the Romanian Wallachia and Transylvania and refugee Serbs from the Ottoman Empire, as well as Serbs from other parts of the monarchy of the Habsburgs. 
The government also organized military regiments, which in its most estavan formed by Serbian soldiers who recibiram special rights in exchange for defending the borders. 
The Hungarians were initially excluded from this process, and the Hungarians fixamento was officially prohibido by the end of the eighteenth century (possibly as a result of the war of independence of Rákóczi, between 1703-11). 
De_acordo with the 1774 data, the population of the Banat of Timi oara If composed of? 
. 
This official census showed a Romanian majority in the east, Serbia in the west, and numerous German colonies throughout the territory. 
With the end of the Imperio_Austrohúngaro at the end of the Primeira_Guerra_Mundial in 1918 the suabos proclaim República_do_Banato a multinational state made up of Romanians, suabos, Serbs and Hungarians, but the application of the concept of nationalities and imposed If the region is over It is divided between Romania and the new state of the Slavs of the sur (only Szeged zone remained in Hungary). 
Most of the suabos of the Banat (and Transylvania) convert was thus citizens of Romania, where the body will have to soportar romenização policy roménias the authorities. 
With the arrival of the Nazis to power in Germany, the suabos no longer suabos roménios be Volksdeutsche. 
That is where began the disappearance of the suaba community. 
The Nazi authorities predicted translate to the German Reich in Romania. 
But the entry of Romania in the Segunda_Guerra_Mundial, next to the to Germany, did change plans; 
now the most urgent was not resettle the Germans in the Reich, but to recruit them to the SS and the Wehrmacht. 
When the war changes direction and Exército_Vermelho invades Romania, many Germans flee; 
on the other weighs the threat of collective punishment. 
The new Soviet authorities proceed aa deportation of thousands of Germans to labor camps in the USSR. 
Not all will return. 
Once the war, the Germans of Romania saved herself, relatively, of mass expulsions that put an end to the presence German in Czechoslovakia and Poland. 
However, the deportations reduciram the community, and the collectivization of the land undermined the socio-economic basis of their existence. 
in the 1970s a group of German-speaking writers roménios founded Banat_Aktionsgruppe. 
If its members considered Marxists and published without problems in the different newspapers and German-speaking editorial Romania. 
What initially formed as an aesthetic reaction against the tradition suaba converted themselves in a political expression of dissent, by what the group was persecuted and finally dissolved by the Securitate. 
The prosecution, attached to the miserable living conditions and generous the policy República_Federal of Germany to repatriate the Germans from the east (in continuity with the Heim ins Reich Hitler) did many suabos abandon Romania to the end of the 1980s. 
Only a few years later, a revolution began precisely in Timio? Oara ends the dictatorship of Ceausescu? Glass sculpture, but the community was already suaba perto_da extinction. 
According to the 2002 census, nos_jude?

Using telescopes of the Observatório_Europeu_Sul (ESO), astronomers have discovered a planet with seven times the mass of Jupiter, the heaviest of them revolving around the sun, and another with twice that weight. 
Both worlds have similar mass aa others have cataloged exoplanets, but do not turn em_torno_de a star - in fact, revolve around one another. 
The Ray_Jayawardhana_e_Valentin_D._Ivanov researchers report the discovery in the edition of Thursday the online service Science_Express, maintained by the journal Science. 
It is a couple of brave brothers, cada_um with cerca_de 1% of the mass of the Sun, Jayawardhana said. 
The mere existence is a surprise, and the origin and destination are a mystery. 
Cerca_de half of the stars of the size of the sun are in pairs. 
The same goes for a sixth of brown dwarfs, heavy bodies enough to generate heat, but not enough to start a nuclear fusion reaction as the legitimate stars. 
in the last five years, astronomers have identified a few dozen of even smaller objects that brown dwarfs that are not bound to any star system, dubbed planetary mass objects or planemos, located on the outskirts of star-forming regions. 
The latest, Oph 162225-240515, is the first double planemo. 
Comparing the data obtained via telescope with theoretical models, Jayawardhana and Ivanov estimated the mass of the pair components and concluded that the double planemo is young in cosmic terms with cerca_de a million years. 
The two are separated by a distance of six times that between the Sun and Pluto and stay at the star nursery Ophiuchus, 400 light-years from Earth. 
It is believed that planets are born from the clouds of dust circulating stars, brown dwarfs, and even some planemos floating free in space. 
But it is likely that these brothers planemos formed together a_partir_de a cloud of gas in contraction that broke in two, like a binary star miniature, Jayawardhana said. 
We are resisting the temptation to call aa pair of double planet because he probably did not form in the way that planets in our solar system appeared, adds Ivanov. nan nan Fotografia_Fine_Art is the picture created according to the vision of the artist as photographer.

Cultivation of bacteria. 
Large scale . 
One of the greatest difficulties to create the new biopesticide was to develop a way to produce the nematodes on a large scale, at a cost that would make the product competitive in relation to chemical insecticides. 
For this, Milk spent a year between 2014 and 2015 in the Departamento_de_Agricultura of the United_States (USDA). 
? It was to develop culture media and processes in the in_vitro production of entomopathogenic nematodes, os_que are in symbiosis with bacteria, trying to make feasible production with low to meet major crops such as sugar cane? , account .
Using a culture medium consisting of egg yolk, vegetable oil and yeast extract, milk say that the cost of nematode production is less than $ 10 for treating 1 hectare. 
The value that must be added the manpower and logistics, por_exemplo, which still makes the price of the competitive product with the agrochemicals. 
? In Brazil, many farmers think that the biological control should be cheaper than the chemical? He says.
? This mentality is not the same in Europe, where farmers give more value to biological control because of the restrictive measures applied to the use of chemicals, por_causa_de its harmful effects.? .
Milk cites other advantages of the use of nematodes instead of agrochemicals. 
These are not inducing resistance to insects, safety for the environment, farm workers and consumers, as it does not hurt aa human health. 
? The worms have great persistence in the environment. 
100 when they invade an insect they feed and multiply dentro_do the body for up to three generations, reaching 100 000 individuals. 
After exhausted this source of food, they go out and look for another pest to invade and repeat the process? Says Leite.
? Nematodes are widely used in the world, but still not in Brazil? , Said José_Roberto_Parra of the Escola_Superior_de_Agricultura_Luiz_de_Queiroz of the Universidade_de_São_Paulo (Esalq USP), an expert in biological control.
? There are difficulties to create them in bulk because they have not completely mastered the production technology. 
Once solved this problem, they will have the same advantages of any microorganism used in the biological control of pest? Says Parra.
? The technology is defined and open to any undertaking having an interest, but the large-scale production still needs to evolve. 
Por_exemplo, the life of commercial nematodes is two to three months and its application depends on the presence of rain, o_que complicates the logistics of distribution in times of drought? Evaluates Luís_Leite.
The Bio_Controle bet mainly in the cane. 
? We are the only company that has a product and are registering aa base entomopathogenic nematodes in Brazil? Ensures Fábio_Silber_Schmidt, researcher of the company.
? It is the Bio_Bacteriophora made aa base of the nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, which will be one of the targets the boll weevil sugarcane. ?
The forecast of the company is that between 2017 and 2018 will be with the definitive record, released to market the product. nan nan Lawyers for more than 500 people who say they are victims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests and religious in the state of California announced on Saturday night, having made a $ 660 million deal (R $ 1.227 billion ) with Los_Angeles Archdiocese to terminate the processes moved against it.
Everything was resolved, said Raymond_Boucher, lawyer of 242 victims. 
I'm glad you finished, said the lawyer of the church, Michael_Hennigan. 
If approved by the court, will be the largest amount paid by a diocese since it became aa surfaced in the US for the first time, a pedophilia scandal in Boston in 2002. 
The Archbishop of Los_Angeles, Roger_Mahony, went public apology -If: 
Mais_uma_vez, I apologize to all who were offended, abused. 
It should never have happened and will not happen again. 
Today, the first trial begins for the case, and more than a dozen are scheduled for the next six months. 
Deal with charges against Clinton_Hagenbach priest, who died in 1987. 
The disclosed arrangement prevents Mahony be called to testify and explain if the church was aware of the abuses - committed between the 40 and 90 - but requires that documents and files are revealed. 
Many of the priests are accused by many victims because they were transferred from parish by his superiors to appear charges. 
Psychological treatment was recommended as it believed was found that the religious could recover. 
The vast majority of the files relating to sexual abuse charges ended in agreements os_quais have cost aa Catholic Church mais_de US $ 1.5 billion in the US. 
The amounts shall be paid by their own dioceses without the help of the Vatican. 
Since 2002, mais_de thousand people were admitted in cases against the Catholic Church for sexual abuse in California and in the past few years, the Archdiocese of Los_Angeles already paid $ 114 million to 86 victims. 
According to Cardinal Mahony, you will now need to sell properties to get afford the deal - and the value could be even greater if the proceedings were to end. 
Each victim contemplated by the settlement should receive mais_de $ 1 million, but discusses quanto_o -if the money will repair the suffering of those who, as children, were abused. 
Indeed, there is no way to go back and return the innocence they were stolen, lamented Mahony, adding that in the past few months, found themselves with many victims, o_que helped him understand the importance of a quick solution to the processes. 
We understand that there are people in desperate need of medical care, therapy, Mary_Grant said one of the victims in California and regional director of the Survivors Network to the abuses of priests. 
They may not be able to stand trial. 
But por_outro_lado, there are many who would really like to have their day in court. .
The president of the organization, David_Clohessy, survivors who managed agreement should be proud. 
Without their courage, dozens of predators would not yet known and perhaps were in parishes today. . nan nan Knowledge for the images.

The use of photography and audiovisual media in cultural anthropology comes from the training times of discipline. 
The teacher Sylvia_Caiuby_Novaes of the Departamento_de_Antropologia of the Faculdade_de_Filosofia, and letters of the Ciências_Humanas Universidade_de_São_Paulo (FFLCH USP), located in the work origins of evolutionary anthropologists. 
For them, the companies would develop according to similar patterns and stages at any time or part of the world, from the primitive ?? ?? civilized ?? the ?? .
Thus, the visual support would be appropriate to witness the evolutionary signals found in the people studied and their ways of life. 
Since then, evolutionary anthropology was supplanted by other theories that have succeeded, and the image only returned aa scene in the 1940s with the work of the Americans Margaret_Mead_ (1901-1978) and Gregory_Bateson (1904-1980) in Bali, to effectively execute in the 1960s with the work of the French Jean_Rouch_ (1917-2004) in Africa. 
Many discussions remain, as opposed to the descriptive registration possibilities and the use of the expressive mode image. 
These and other issues were discussed by the theme design ?? The experience of the film in anthropology ?? Coordinated by Sylvia between 2010 and 2015.
It was the third and last of an interconnected series, totaling 18 years of research. 
In its beginnings, the researcher observes, ?? the photograph was taken as a resource to overcome the painting, in the measure that would capture an objective reality, and even today is often addressed as if they lie ?? ?? ?? .
For the researcher, what ?? visual search anthropology is to know how to use the images, either as a strategy or search result ?? .
The search for new languages, according to Sylvia, part of the principle that ?? our scientific rationality, impregnated muitas_vezes of positivism, it is very suitable to handle different of our universes ?? .

The project followed two lines of research. 
The first, ?? Photography, ethnographic film and anthropological reflection ?? Theory and practice?? He sought to understand the approaches and distances between anthropological theory and the realization of photos and movies.
According to Sylvia, ?? the greatest challenge in this line of research is the ability to incorporate new audiovisual languages ​​the great questions of contemporary anthropology ?? .
A film sample produced in the framework of the thematic project and this line of research is pepper in the eyes, which originated in the dialogue with the locals peppers, neighborhood in the outskirts of Guarulhos (SP), mediated by the realization workshops and photo exhibitions with the intention of exploring space issues, imaginary and community memory. 
Another study that approaches the possibilities of photography with anthropological reflection is in one of the articles of the book Between art and science ?? Photography in anthropology, signed by the Joon_Ho_Kim researcher, PhD in anthropology by FFLCH-USP.
The book is one of the projections of the theme, with texts and pictures made by some of the researchers. 
Joon appealed aa photo to a shared work with athletes in wheelchairs playing rugby. 
The intention with the research, which won the Grande_Prêmio_Capes_de_Tese in the area of ​​humanities, was seeking registration of the precise details that reveal the violence, the agility and the shock of bodies and machines matches. 
Joon thus wanted to capture ?? aspects able to deconstruct the stigma of immobility by the construction of images opposed to those that suggest victimization ?? .
The second line of research, ?? The expression of ethnographic knowledge: 
borders and dialogue between anthropology and the arts ?? He studied audiovisual achievement in the production of anthropological knowledge.
According to Sylvia, the hybrid aspect of the images (between real and constructed), especially photography, allows the connection between art, knowledge and information. 
?? Of the humanities, the closest of the arts is anthropology, partly because we deal with unconscious aspects of social life. ?? .

Thus, some of the films have overcome the traditional gap between scientific research and artistic work. 
A study on youth in Cidade_Tiradentes, on the outskirts of São_Paulo adopted the fictional format to be adapted to the audiovisual medium. 
The film, Fabrik funk, the reality of a dream, signed by Rose_Hikiji for Sylvia and the Alexandrine_Boudreault-Fournier anthropologist of the Universidade_de_Victoria in Canada, tells the story of a funkeira and was made by the shared anthropology method, where the studied community participated in the elaboration of the work on the script and production. 
?? Are there any data research but, if we had made a documentary in the classic mold, the approach probably would be less rich ?? Says Sylvia.
Mais_de 50 films were produced in the context of the three themed designs. 
They were involved in the latest phase 27 researchers. 
According to the researcher, the project consolidated in the FFLCH-USP anthropology area of ​​the expressive forms, which studies the relationship between anthropology and the different areas of artistic expression.

Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela, has the highest concentration of atmospheric electrical discharges of the world. 
Somewhere in the world is falling a distance at this moment. 
in the Earth atmospheric electrical discharges 44 occur every second (nearly 4 millions per day). 
It is estimated that only 20% of them reach the ground and the rest occur in the interior of the clouds. 
The place of the planet where there are more rays is the Lake Maracaibo, in the west of Venezuela, the largest of the South_America. 
The clouds that form over the 13 000 square kilometers (km2) of its surface? the major axis is 160 km? generate cerca_de 8000 rays a day, according to a survey published in February this year, which identified the 500 points of the planet with the most atmospheric electrical discharges.
Here, the frequency of these bright events is so great that the Spanish writer Lope_de_Vega already referred to the lake and its many rays in the epic poem La dragontea, 1598. 
The rays, according to the work, they would have prevented a British invasion to the city of Maracaibo, in the vicinity of the lake. 
There are also reports that in the past, the lake served as a beacon for navigators of the Caribbean, por_causa_dos the flashes in the sky at night. 
The main reason for the high frequency of the phenomenon in the place is called convergence night breeze, explains meteorologist Rachel_Albrecht, a professor of the Departamento_de_Ciências_Atmosféricas of the Instituto_de_Astronomia, Geophysics and Ciências_Atmosféricas of the Universidade_de_São_Paulo (IAG-USP). 
She is the first author of the world ranking of atmospheric electrical discharges, developed in partnership with researchers from the United_States and accepted for publication in the Bulletin of the American_Meteorological_Society. 
The convergence is such phenomenon arising from environmental combination: 
the existence of a large tropical lake surrounded by a relief very rugged. 
During the day, the continent heats up much faster than the water of the lake. 
The temperature difference is the wind blowing from the lake to the mainland, em_direção_às the mountains that form the bay of Maracaibo. 
Have aa night, the direction of the breeze is reversed. 
The mountains and the continent cool down before the lake, whose warm waters provide moisture to the atmosphere. 
aa as it rises, the vapor condenses and forms deep storm cloud with ice crystals and hail, that when they collide with each other millions and millions of times in the inside of the clouds, causing transfer of electric charges. 
As a result, the electric field increases, and the rays are formed. 
? The rays fall more often around 3 o'clock in the morning in the local time? Says Rachel.
According to meteorologists, most of the continental regions presents the maximum rays aa afternoon, especially during the so-called summer storms. 
056-057 Rays 243Raios by the world. 
The study defined the Lake Maracaibo as a world leader of electrical discharges in the atmosphere? in this region occurs every year, an average of 232 rays per square kilometer? used data collected from 1998 to 2013 by the Tropical_Rainfall_Measuring_Mission satellite of NASA, the US space agency.
Located 405 km from the surface of the Earth, the satellite has sensors that capture optical pulses that result from the interaction of the rays with the gas clouds. 
Importantly, these sensors record both electrical discharges that occur in the interior of the clouds as they reach the ground. 
The present study used a resolution five times higher than the previous ones, allowing detection discharges that occur in areas of the surface of the globe which correspond to 0.1 degree? aa near the equator line, the measure corresponds to a square with sides cerca_de to 10 kilometers.
Although the point of the planet with the highest density of rays (number of events per km2 per year) is in the South_America, the region with the largest number of sites with very rays is Africa. 
of the 500 sites analyzed, more than half (283) are in Africa, most between the center and the west of Africa. 
in Asia, there are 87 points with a high incidence of lightning; 
in America of the South are 67 and the América_do_Norte, 53. 
Oceania is the continent with fewer points, only 10. 
in Africa, the region with the highest density of rays (205 per km2 per year) is the República_Democrática of the Congo. 
The country has 2.3 million square kilometers and its skies are formed 95 million electrical discharges per year. 
Although the Brazilian regions appear only a_partir_da the 191ª position in this ranking, the country with a land area nearly four times that of the Congo, is the world champion in absolute number of rays: 
are 108 million electrical discharges in the atmosphere per year. 
The Brazilian region with the highest density of rays is northwest of Manaus, in the middle of the Amazon forest. 
in this area occur 68 rays per square kilometer per year, the study of which Rachel participated. 
An earlier survey, conducted by the Grupo_de_Eletricidade_Atmosférica (Elat) of the Instituto_Nacional_de_Pesquisas_Espaciais (INPE), indicated the city of Porto_Real in the Rio_de_Janeiro, as the place where more focussed rays in the country. 
There, the frequency was approximately 20 electrical discharges per square kilometer per year. 
The difference, Osmar_Pinto_Júnior, coordinator of the Elat, is the result of different measurement strategies. 
The Elat uses monitoring networks that are installed only in the South, Southeast, Central Oeste_e_Nordeste of the country. 
Além_de have a more restricted distribution, these networks are composed of surface sensors that detect radiation invisible to the naked eye generated by the discharges that reach the ground. 
The number registered northwest of Manaus is the total discharges, including both those that occur in the interior of the clouds as they reach the ground. 
Since the density measured by the Elat is in Porto_Real maximum discharges reach the soil. 
? Are maximum of different magnitudes for different regions? Explains Pinto_Júnior.
Apesar_das the different measurement strategies, the concentration of rays is quite high in the Porto_Real region. 
? Resende, a neighboring town? Says Rachel? Appears in the 396ª position in the global ranking of rays and in the 10th position among the Brazilian regions? . nan nan at least 549 people died and 295 are still missing in the £ conseqÃ¼Ãªncia of the floods that hit South Kor © ia_do_Norte in July, according to a newspaper japonÃªs prÃ³-Pyongyang.

reason: 
They will end subsidies for agricultural production and there is a new program to encourage the abandonment of the land. 
Some investments less correct, with the money of the EEC, they began to cause difficulties. 
However, IFADAP's days are numbered. 
The Alentejo farm buildings are being placed in the housing market for sale at a dizzying pace. 
The farmers in the most affected districts are Beja, Évora and Portalegre, report that cerca_de half of the farms located in these districts are already aa sale. 
However, an expert source in the rural property market Alentejo, told The Independent that the percentage of farms aa sale is not as high and should situate themselves in cerca_de 30 percent of the total and focuses especially on large estates. 
in the District of Beja, adn the exception of the most fertile terrras, as they are "the pottery of Beja 'land without agricultural potential are for sale mainly in the municipality of Mértola. 
in the District of Portalegre, the region of Almodovar and Castro Verde lands are also placed in the housing market. 
Even the irrigation of Alcacer also they began to sell, not only due to the drought that is true, but as a result of the EEC evil monies applied and they often were for luxury cars or vacation homes. 
in the farms of the list available in the market are already properties with reasonable dimensions or with known owners. 
Celluloses who had acquired land in this region are now selling them. 
The President of the CAP, Rosado_Fernandes, just exchange the ownership "of the kitties' means a land with cerca_de 340 hectares. 
João_Geada also has "disposed" of some properties that had recently acquired in the Alentejo, Torralta is also transact properties in this regtão. 
Other known estates, are changing owners. 
This is the case of the water farm -all-the-year, Herdade_Sertâ the Garrochais, and the Dona_Maria, all located in the district of Evora. 
Even foreigners who in recent years have gone aa purchase of land in the Alentejo have started the stampede. 
The situation is even more serious quanto_não there are buyers which results in the sale of the lands be made much lower than the market prices. 
Amounts which are located, when the market is standardized, and a land with a size of cerca_de 500 hectares between 200 thousand crowns and 800 thousand crowns per hectare, as is rainfed or irrigation are to be traded values ​​almost paltry. 
In fact, one of the causes of the despair of the sale results from banking commitments that many farmers are not able to meet, what muitas_vezes obliged to divest If valuable asset and have deep family roots. 
In some cases the main cause of this situation is the failure of the agricultural projects developed with the help of EU funds. 
According to sources from the agricultural sector, this should situção themselves to poor management of these funds which in some cases were diverted, em_parte, for the purchase of luxury cars, lavish homes and other superfluous equipment. 
Refer Alentejo sources that "farmers have not quantified the costs of financing projects in non-reimbursed part, and when it came time to pay the bank were undercapitalized." 
For others, the sale of the farms is simply a result of the capitalization of the farmers themselves that even with the aid community failed to create obtain sufficient own resources to make the costs and very high interest rates. 
This crisis is hitting agricultural credit banks since in some cases the loans have exceeded the values ​​set for the land seizure. 
In any case the crisis of the agricultural sector is identified as the main cause of the debacle in the race to the sales of farms. 
The policy itself to foster the competitiveness of prices was not achieved nor any government strategy to encourage agricultural production. 
Guess If ((sic)) which in the future can only get stuck aa land who have a reasonable extent and are not dependent on bank financing. 
The sale of land in the Alentejo is a consequence of the crisis that the agricultural sector is experiencing with the new common agricultural policy, which will come with the reform of the CAP. 
Indeed the agricultural sector provides that even this year the number of projects for agricultural development ((sic)) will fall significantly and put the technical IFADAP idly. 
Under the new policy all agricultural support will be channeled to the abandonment of agricultural land for agroforestry or promote the production of non-food crops. 
A new policy aimed at subsidizing the income and not to production and to reduce the Portuguese agricultural population by half. 
And the funds intended to start this process will not be meager. 
According to The Independent found the funding package for under the new CAP to proceed to the abandonment of the properties in order to land consolidation and land restructuring is similar to the amount available for aid to agricultural prices, but strengthened. 
For now, Community incentive programs such as the production pa pa for modernization of the agricultural holdings, or their transformation, have been extended. 
But they do not know how to continue. 
This uncertainty is discouraging farmers who have already submitted a project in the IFADAP do not show a second. 
A situation that is already having repercussions on the future of the IFADAP. 
Fewer projects to analyze and a staff that will be vacated. 
However, the Government is prepared to change the route of this institute oo emptying their skills will be inevitable, according to The Independent found. 
This financial institute to aa date has managed the funds for the development of agriculture under lines of credit aimed aa modernization of farms, processing and marketing, the PEDAP eao of the vineyard restructuring program, approved 10 cerca_de thousand projects in 1991, an investment of 88 billion escudos subsidized 51.5 million. 
For the year 1992 it is for a grant for new agricultural projects of the order of 54 billion escudos. 
The process of "emptying powers' of the IFADAP has already begun. 
Premiums for the support aa termination of farming and rural land consolidation, a new program already approved by the government, will not be realized via IFADAP but will be developed exclusively with the competence of the Ministério_da_Agricultura through its agencies. 
Incidentally, an institute with these characteristics of "non-banking" controlled by two ministries, of Agriculture and of Finance does not exist in the communities in the remaining EU countries, refer some more skeptical sources quanto_à the opportunity to continue to be a body with these characteristics. 
Por_outro_lado, IFADAP has been the target of criticism. 
And challenged by the industry in the lack of transparency of the selection criteria of the projects submitted. 
Por_outro_lado is viewed with suspicion the activity it carries on the interbank market, using existing cash surplus for the delay in the time between receipt of the Community grant and the delivery to the candidates. 
Another reason that creates some discomfort with the authorities is the shared responsibility of the Ministérios_das_Finanças and Agriculture on this institute which prevents the full development and centralized agricultural policy on Ministério_da_Agricultura. 
Contacted by 0 Independent Alvaro_Amaro, Secretary of State for Agriculture confirmed the Independent 0 which is an ongoing project of restructuring the IFADAP. 
A project that is being studied jointly by the Ministério_da_Agricultura and Ministério_das_Finanças. 
The main result of this study will be the organic change IFADAP added this member of the government. 
in this mode the Ministério_da_Agricultura intends to introduce greater flexibility in the management of that body and simultaneously accelerate ((sic)) the allocation process of subsidies to farmers. 
A process has been very time consuming. 
Another measure that affect the Ifadap consists of the rationalization of personnel working in this organism. 
in this moment and over the decrease of the Community support for agricultural development, there is already surplus staff necessary for the development of the skills of IFADAP. 
However, and in the words of the state secretary of agriculture, rationalization measure IFADAP insert themselves in a broader context that includes the restructuring of the Ministério_da_Agricultura own. 
A process that will go through the replacement of staff, transfer functions além_da the placement of some of the surplus frame. 
Early retirement for the farming population ((sic)) great guideline of the future CAP will soon start themselves in Portugal. 
The designated "Programa_Operacional» approved by the Commission of the Communities to Portugal, will start its implementation, even this second year told The Independent Secretary of State of the Alvaro_Amaro agriculture. 
The program will last 10 years and If begins with a test phase with a duration of two years involves an amount of 7.5 billion PTE. 
They are fundamentally two measures to be taken. 
Those designed to encourage land consolidation of rural land and simultaneously the cessation of farming, with the award of a prize. 
Visa themselves with these two measures, combining a rural land consolidation policy of rejuvenating the business world.

Hurricanes of Category 5 are rare, but in 2005 were recorded four, including Katrina, reinforcing research that suggests global warming may increase the strength of tropical cyclones. nan nan in the design that will appear in this long and fascicular analysis La social-democratie quand même the time came for the theme that we consider most innovative, and that includes, if we limit ourselves aa work of Fejto, Swedish experiences enrichment of the work, co-management and Meidner plan.
The enrichment work was born in the United_States was applied in many places, but its most authentic trial should have taken place in the social-democratic Sweden. 
Say enrichment work is to say that before this enrichment work was poor or less rich ... 
To explain in the have to pick the point at the beginning of the century, aa scientific organization of the work of Winslow_Taylor, whose most famous thesis recommends the decomposition of gestures that perform a given work and the timing of their times. 
It was (largely) on Taylor's ideas that created the chain work. 
We admit that he has made exaggerated and caricatured descriptions, since of this in the prevents Georges_Friedmann in Or va le travail humain. 
But the testimony of those who lived through the chain, from the old to the recent Navel Haraszti, let Us to print a destructive work ... 
in the However, for our purpose, no matter a radical position or more nuancé. 
The chain work dismisses the thought, for him to be even harmful, in their tendency to complete automation of gestures. 
From a psychological point of view, the work itself chain (regardless of what is happening in the head of the operator) does not involve more than what a spinal activity. 
(The expression is Friedmann). 
So o_que's richest man in the (thinking, voluntary act ...) 
does not enter, or enters very little in the chain work. 
There is therefore a human impoverishment. 
This is why it comes as a reaction, or correction of the chain work, enrichment work, also called (and after what we have said will find yourselves why) humanization of work. 
Initially, employers and managers boasted, with virtually no restrictions, this first taylor-Fordism that brought them productivity gains, embaratecia them the workforce and increasing the profitability of the capital ... 
But by the 40s, the great American industry began to complain -If of their difficulties with staff: 
the workers worked poorly, kept claiming, at the slightest pretext interrupted work ... 
-If the doctor called these diseases, psycho-sociologist, said that suffer the fatigue of workers repetitive gestures that the system imposed on them, the lack of pleasure taken from the work, lack of taste for the job. 
in a word, the robot control. 
Among the various remedies prescribed by the psycho-sociologists found -if the job enrichment. 
(To compensate for a bit of linearity of the historical background that we leave here the news of the back-face Henry_Ford in 1945, distancing -If of Taylorism and arguing that the creative industry should move to grant more interest to the human factor . 
Analysts of the ideology will take care to remove the cover of humanism Ford discovering the active ingredient that moved necessarily the maximum profit. 
This fact however does not take away that Ford is not only for the action on the organization of work as per the practice of the idea that the producer is simultaneously a consumer, one of the decisive men of contemporary history. )
We put this introito, since we can translate aa -In Sweden, Volvo and Saab-Scania factories. 
Reigns there (probably with some humanization inks because we are already in the first years of 70) taylor-Fordism, the infernal cadences: 
in the assembly line reach the same gesture repeat 40 If 40 seconds. 
This rationality but has its price: 
alienation of the work (the more understandable as the education is high Swedish workers), high absenteeism, an annual rotation personnel that reaches 60%. 
It is in this situation that arises a new organization of work, animated by ideas that go against the grain of the sub-division of tasks, such as: 
the formation of small teams of workers, each receiving the indication of the task with which they compete and the overall compensation allowing members of the team share among themselves the task and the salary assigned to the group, delivery aa decision of the team of a margin in regard to the pace of work ... 
But for a better understanding of what constitutes this new organization of the work we transcribe the description by Michel_Bosquet of the variant implemented in Saab-Scania. 
The groups consist of three workers. 
They have, in principle, 30 minutes to assemble an engine: 
carburetor, filter, water pump, etc. .
The workers can organize work in two ways aa your choice: 
each working 30 minutes in your own motor, or three working for 10 minutes in the same engine, thereby effecting cada_qual a third of the set of the task. 
Are the workers who put the engines, once assembled in the proper place. 
If mount three engines each in por_exemplo 80 minutes instead of 90, will have an additional 10 minute break. 
Faced with this description can up well to analyze and judge of the importance of the organization of the work carried out by Volvo and Saab. 
But interest will first display the results. 
The facilities for the new organization were 10% more expensive than what the appropriate type of previous organization. 
Assembly time ascertained -If be pretty much the same. 
But absenteeism and turnover decreased, the latter averaging 20%. 
And the need for supervisors made herself, naturally smaller. 
Take stock, experience appeared positive. 
from the point of view of the subjectivity of workers, condensaremos change on the review of one of them: 
Now I can go to the bathroom without having to lift your finger as a school boy. 
And this account. 
The change in the work chain that were made in Volvo and Saab-Scania for this enrichment of the work will seem small. 
But it is not insignificant. 
Notice was found that there is an inversion of meaning: 
before, the logic was to parcelization in the decomposition of the work; 
in the new system, there is a restoration of the tasks. 
If broke a trend. 
And with the restoration, some enrichment occurs. 
to have the choice as aa way to accomplish the task and a certain power of choice in the pace of work, the worker increases your space of freedom. 
when composing an object (an engine in the case that we have seen, but in a variant of the Volvo four groups of ten workers assemble an automobile), the work gets to who executes a sense, um_pouco more sense of what when it came to repeat a maximally parcelizada task. 
Ulla Jeanneney speaks of a re-creation of small workshops that many workers would retain the nostalgia. 
If there is fear that can observation in one sentimental passadismo no reason to exist. 
But suffers no doubt that this work in small teams creates an atmosphere of humanizing solidarity that is not in the job chain that previously performed, and that robotizava. 
Since the restoration of the tasks stands at a higher yield and enjoys the favor of the workers, dir -se - fatal was his generalization. 
But there is a deterrent. 
That organization of work, to empower the workers on the conditions of work, is seen by the sacred power of the boss in the company as one of the first steps in a way that tends to take away. 
of resistance there. 
(But it should also be noted -if the quanto_aos skepticism the results of the experience nourished by some observers. 
V ob. 
cit. 
of François_Fetjo, p. 88).
But there are reasons to suppose that the resistance stuck in a absolutism to recede property. 
The most modern employers are willing to accept experiences such as Volvo and Saab, profitable in many ways. 
Social democracy and democratic socialism (we always employ these terms interchangeably), reaching the roof of the redistribution of income up, will see naturally obliged to put an emphasis on the redistribution of the power (regionalization, industrial democracy , etc. ) . 
Finally, the concerns of the Church quanto_à the dignity of the working head in the sense that it will experience as we point. nan nan per least 80 people were killed and over 165 were injured in Monday aft the Collision £ the two passenger trains in the delta of the Nile, north of Cairo, police and medium © tips sources.

Other poets give themselves to a nap, from time to time, to the detriment of the tune and the eloquence of the speech. 
But, unfortunately, it is not only the poets who allow themselves dozing. 
The gods too. 
This happened once in Clio, muse of history who, bored of the immense tapestry millennial in charge, full of gray colors and covered with redundant and monotonous designs, left drooping blond head and fell asleep for a moment, as his fingers for inertia, continued to frame. 
Soon they enlearam two wires and the design is blistered a node, destoante_da the smoothness of the fabric. 
Amalgamated so If the dates of June 4, 1148 and September 29, 1984. 
Motorists that in this September morning came in Lisbon by the Avenida_Gago_Coutinho, rights to Areeiro, began to take a big scare, and for a moment it was on the entire area, a high-pitched sound of desmultiplicados engines, brakes applied thoroughly, and a sarabande of businas deafening. 
All this mixture with metal rattling, neighing horses and guttural expletives for high screams. 
Is that in the same time, the troops of the Almohad Ibn-el-Muftar composed of Berbers, Azenegues and Arabs in number up to ten thousand, sneaky vineyard for the ditch, almost aa edge of the river estuary that there then emptied, in order to put siege to the walls of Lixbuna a year ago besieged and taken by hordes of odious Nazarenes. 
Suddenly saw -if the army surrounded by thousands of metal cars, flashing colors in the middle of a thunderous roar - which replaced the soft chirp of the birds and the sweet hum of the horseflies - and flanked by colossal walls everywhere they stood, covered with bright windows. 
If frightened the Bedouins, volteando assarapantados horses in the narrow space of maneuver that was left to him, and Ali ben Yusuf, lieutenant Muftar, a devout man who feared God wanted right there apear treated to pray , after elevation hands to heaven and hailed that Allah was great. 
That Allah was great was the head of the troop convinced, but did not seem the right time to louvaminhas that the situation required before practical solutions and touch. 
Caught the designs of the deputy with a brutal gesture, raised high the green banner and shouted an order that was repeated squad on squad, until last aa rear, already very close to the Rotunda_da_Encarnação: 
- Let no one messed! 
And el - Muftar, trusting the tapered beard, and giving a way to the turban, considered with keen air, the pandemonium around: - They would have fallen in all the Quranic hell? 
They would have done some harm to Allah? 
Often they are victims of a pass from Christian witchcraft? 
Or treating -se - was a game of jinns encabriolados? 
While the Arab reflected from the top of his thoroughbred, the agent of second-class PSP 
Manuel_Reis_Tobias in aa service entrance to Avenida_Gago_Coutinho, half hidden behind the columns of a building, in the wise and commendable purpose to surprise offenders to the traffic lights, understood that it was not right and that it was appropriate. 
Feeling up very alone to take account of the occurrence, transmitted to the command post for the intercom of the bike, a complicated message, full of numbers and figures, which could sum was thus: 
An indeterminate multitude of individuals of males, most of which carry knives and other blunt objects, sharp and piercing, with carnival flags and costumes, mounted on solipeds had invaded Avenida_Gago_Coutinho and part of the Areeiro in unauthorized demonstration. 
Since it seemed to him there is insecurity for the movement of people and goods on the public highway, waiting for orders and spent aa listening. 
There told him that they would arrange and which merely witnessing the events, but not intervene for now. 
An immediate call to Governador_Civil and this for the Minister confirmed that there were parades planned, so that the police machine found himself moved the -If ingest in the case. 
Sirens sounded in the barracks of Bethlehem and a few minutes later, some platoons of the Polícia_de_Intervenção were on their way, with great fanfare of sirens and blinkers multicolored. 
However, Ibn-el-Muftar via the front by a large crowd that apeada apostrofava his soldiers. 
Were drivers who had come out of the cars and that between angry and amused, were engaged in a loud whoop. 
That must be some complain, some said; 
it was but it was for a movie, said others. 
the Moor, that whole peonage not appeared particularly threatening, especially as the surrounding crowd, dressed in strange outfits, did not seem to show any kind of weapons. 
So that Ibn-Muftar chose to maneuver carefully in the little space available. 
With some signs of the cutlass made one or two squadrons formed, with difficulty, in the parking lot of the Areeiro, and people standing phalanx if arrumasse in the yard of the service station from the opposite side, while the bulk of the troops occupied the central grassed board. 
He decided not to be impressed with the unfriendly gestures that came from dentro_dos metal objects with wheels that were everywhere or with faces staring at him from behind a strange transparent material. 
If was an incantation, better it was to let pass - whispered to Ben - Yusuf answered him, suspicious and very pale: 
- inch Allah! 
Manuel of the Silva_Lopes leading one of those annoying truckloads of beer bars that Providence charge of ensarilhar transits in Lisbon, decided at a bad time leaving the steering wheel, dismount herself, and certainly by jealous competition, appoint a pebble kid that was echoed in the buckler the Mamud_Beshewer Bedouin who, having not yet agreed to all this, was one of the quietest of the troops. 
Desprezivamente, Ibn-Muftar gave an order and then twenty archers enristaram arches, pointed to the heavens, and dispatched with a strained whine, a hail of arrows, which forced everyone to put themselves in the car and seek refuge on the doors of the buildings or atrás_dos trucks. 
It came from Areeiro a great whoop of this time convinced in unison. 
Now was this cry that the Commissioner Nunes, newly - arrived Alameda_D._Afonso_Henriques aa, aa front of their shock squads, misinterpreted. 
There was a whoop, cause the noise, called the commissioner. 
It was, once again, the rabble to challenge the police. 
- Toca to sweep it all to Areeiro - he said. 
And pulling the whistle, put the team in action, torturing pa a_eito, here and beyond. 
It was not a little of people who thus swept out of the blue yesterday, so that the riot police squads progressed with difficulty and only managed to get to Areeiro some time later, after much head start and two low on their hosts, agents that had been wisely attracted the vain of stairs for more expeditious popular. 
Expelled part of the crowd for Bairro_dos_Actores in the middle of a tremendous din, Commissioner Nunes, panting, regrouped his men in the square of the Areeiro, em_cima_da the lawn plate, with great loss of the planted there dahlias and hydrangeas. 
But ibn -el - Muftar showed was then greatly annoyed by all the rumors and confusion around, and especially by the zipped water that someone had dropped from one of the windows and imbued him with the robe and chain mail . 
When he saw those shield pedestrians and visor, formed on, he thought it was, in short, the advance guard of Ibn-Arrik, the dog maker Lixbuna, who was there to catch HIM pitch, under cover of a magic spell. 
at a glance, broke a load of Berber horsemen, the war cries of cutlass in hand, flanking car, denting bonnets, and approaching inexorably If the boys of the Commissioner Nunes. 
These in conscience did not feel prepared to face Moorish cavalry charges: 
graduation fluctuated, whirled, broke If and when the first alfanges loomed next to a bus Carris, as the men of the briosos Polícia_de_Intervenção ran a good run up aa brewery Munich, where they took refuge atrás_do the counter, leaving the moirama lady of the central board of the Plaza de Areeiro. 
By that time, since the troops of the Rally and to the Escola_Prática_de_Administração_Militar, there to Lumiar, they had received orders to intervene. 
And in good time, because the commissioner Nunes and his people, trapped in Munich, to see through the Arab horse, threatening and façanhudo air, felt -If increasingly less secure. 
Shielded the Rally failed to pass the além_do the Incarnation District. 
They occupied the left of the track, to reach mais_depressa, and eventually see If involved in a traffic jam with ghastly lorries. 
Better luck had the Aurélio_Soares captain aa front of their stewards company. 
They left their vehicles in front of the Vava in the Avenue of the United_States, and rocked in there for race step down by the grassy track to establish contact with the troop ibn -el - Muftar in the intersection with Gago_Coutinho. 
Captain Aurelio brought instructions to carry out a recognition, assess the situation and act accordingly, but always in moderation. 
So which provided his people in gunmen, after civilians away with energetic screams, and measured what had by forward: 
were thousands of Moors, most of which the horse, which tightened in the Gago_Coutinho, through the car and rush hour traffic. 
- These things only happen to me to me! 
- I regretted -if the captain to himself, oblivious to the many thousands of weekenders who were at the time confronted with the phenomenon. 
- Well, let's see ... 
And he commanded high, to the side: 
- You come in here with me, ó_nosso second lieutenant, and bring a prá security section! 
Cautiously, the seven men, finger on the trigger, approached -If of the mourama. 
on this occasion, ibn el Muftar and his staff down the avenue to observe the general state of the army, and came face to the embassy of Captain Soares, aa caution waved a white cloth, borrowed from the renters of a ground - floor of the neighborhood. 
the Arab instinctively appeared If HIM are those military men and although not quite realize the significance of the white banner brandished the captain did not seem that the intentions were suspect. 
Circumstances, por_outro_lado with all the strange mess around, advised the compromise. 
Thus arranged has been known since the parliamentary logo. 
The trot, broken by the front of a picket to Companhia_dos_Telefones I looked at everything with a startled air, headed If the captain, and saluted, hand on his chest: 
- Salam aleikum. 
And Captain Smith, who had a commission in Guinea, in contact with Muslim people, replied automatically, If bending a bit: 
- Aleikum Salam. 
in this moment, the goddess Clio woke up from his dream, for a start, and then looked on the mistake. 
in a creed, broke yarn exchange and reappointed each character to his own time. 
So that, as they had arisen, so if the Arabs are gone from the Avenida_Gago_Coutinho, leaving the Capitão_Soares and all others scratching their heads, stunned. 
Ibn-el-Muftar, in turn, when he saw evict If the fields of those people, of those objects and those buildings, let out a sigh of relief and decided creepy way, giving up attack Lixbuna where, incidentally, contrary eao of what he thought, since ibn - Arrik waited with war machines and fires lit in the walls. 
The Arab considered all those appearances of bad omen, little conducive to happy assaults Lisbon, and gave up the city. 
The muse Clio had no power to make the events recorded since they returned to point zero. 
of this is not the father of the gods could. 
But could obnubilar the memory of men with water spray from the river Lethe, so that a few seconds after the events described, or the Moorish troop ibn -el - Muftar remembered the spell which had arisen on the path, neither the Commissioner Nunes knew what he was doing hiding atrás_do the counter to Munich, or captain Smith knew for there was strolling with the troop in the bottom of the Avenue of the United_States, nor the guard second class of the PSP , Manuel_Tobias knew because he had given that traffic jam, or Colonel Vaz_Rolão of the Rally, knew how he had ended up aa road and left a self-machine gun is enfeixasse in a TIR truck.
the ibn-Muftar was not very burdensome the event, as took the way back to the talar Chantarim fields on the banks of the Tagus, with great advantage of trophies and spoils. 
Worse was to Commissioner Nunes, Captain Smith and Colonel Rolão explain in martial o_que process were to do in those areas aa front of armed detachments. 
He spoke up very insurrection, in those days, and newspapers passionately followed the course of the processes. 
As aa goddess Clio, was deprived of ambrosia for four years which, face it, is certainly not a deterrent punishment for new distractions. nan nan The Orvieto Cathedral is a major religious building of the city of Orvieto in Italy, dedicated aa Virgem_Maria.

The cornerstone was laid on November 13, 1290 and the works lasted for three centuries, with a style that shows the evolution of the Romanesque to the Gothic.

He was originally in the center of the ship, but was moved to the apse around 1540. 
Behind the altar there is a series of partially ruined Gothic frescoes, dedicated aa life of the Virgem_Maria, occupying all the walls of the chapel. 
They were created in 1370 by local artist Ugolino di Prete_Ilario and some employees, such as Pietro di Puccino, Cola_Petruccioli and Andrea di Giovanni.

Among other achievements, the national team adds two titles of the Campeonato_Mundial, a gold medal in the Athens Jogos_Olímpicos-04 and Copa_do_Mundo of Japan in 2003. 
His next goal is the Jogos_Pan-Americanos_do_Rio. 
The team will have little time to celebrate his younger done. 
July 23, led the Bernardinho will make their debut in the Pan Rio diante_do Canada in the gym Maracanãzinho. 
In Santo Domingo-03, the national team failed and finished third. nan nan Senator João_Pedro (PT-AM), draftsman of the second complaint against Renan_Calheiros (PMDB-AL) in the Senate, has confirmed that it will present on Wednesday, 26, in the doConselho meeting of Ethics, request forbearance ( temporary suspension) of investigations into the case.
The PT had given evidence that would ask the filing the case, but the idea now is to wait until the investigations are completed in the Câmara_dos_Deputados because there is the involvement of Renan's brother Olavo_Calheiros Deputy (PMDB-AL). 
He would have sold with a factory price acima_do the market for the brewery Schincariol. 
In exchange, the company, with debt of R $ 100 million in the Instituto_Nacional of the Seguro_Social (INSS), would have been favored by Senator Renan_Calheiros along aa Security. 
According João_Pedro, the goal is to stop the process in the Senate until the Board completes its investigation or in the least confirm that Renan_Calheiros allegedly practiced trafficking em_favor_da influence Schincariol. 
Suspend any file is not, is to copy the more aa work ahead, he said denying that the strike is a maneuver to file representation. 
we are not filing. 
There is no filing the representation number two. 
We are waiting and it may further have developments in the investigation, he added. 
João_Pedro made it clear that will systematically monitor the investigations of the House Conselho_de_Ética. 
The work of the House are already advanced and can bring new elements to the process. 
We will have access to the records and the testimony involving Olavo_Calheiros said. 
The proposal will be presented by Senator must go through polling the other members of the Conselho_de_Ética. 
The forbearance agreement had a significant number of members of the House, he said. 
João_Pedro also said that in this Tuesday should meet with the rapporteur of the case in the House, Mr José_Carlos_Araújo (PR-BA), to address the issue. 
The president of the Conselho_de_Ética of the Senate, Senator Leomar_Quintanilha (PMDB-TO), admitted that he will work to try to unify for the least two of the three representations in progress against Renan, in the meeting of the marked body for this Wednesday. 
in the past week, Quintanilha had positioned themselves against the possibility of joining processes. 
in the second, however, he stressed that the unification could speed up investigations. 
The measure, he said, would also solve another problem: 
the difficulty of finding rapporteurs for the processes. 
Find a single rapporteur is already difficult, imagine finding one for each process, pondered. 
The position of Quintanilha has the support of some senators, but it is not well seen by the opposition. 
According to him, they could be unified the number of representations three four against Renan and dealing, respectively, the purchase of charges of radio and newspaper through oranges and kickback collection in ministries headed by the PMDB. 
Unify the representation of Schincariol would be difficult because it is already in another stage, said the president of the Conselho_de_Ética, referring itself to the investigation into the alleged favoring of the brewery, through Renan, with the Instituto_Nacional of the Seguro_Social (INSS ) adn Receita_Federal after Schincariol have bought a soda factory the Calheiros family for R $ 27 million, if not more than would do_que R $ 10 million, according to market assessments. 
The position of Quintanilha has the support of some senators, but it is not well seen by the opposition. 
The meeting of the council was scheduled to examine the opinion of the rapporteur João_Pedro (PT-AM) exactly on the related process aa Schincariol. 
João_Pedro has warned that plans to ask the stoppage of the matter diante_de a consensus that it would be better to wait the results of the investigations which the Chamber of Deputies is doing about the same complaint. 
The meeting is scheduled for 17 hours. nan nan's short and medium-term weather forecasts recorded major improvements in recent years, but it is necessary to continue to invest in the network of collection stations per year worldwide.
What, in the opinion of the Secretary General of the Organização_Meteorológica_Mundial does not rule out the need to develop research in this area. 
But never for the purpose of modifying the climate. 
The Secretary-General of the Organização_Meteorológica_Mundial (WMO), Godwin_Obasi considers the strengthening of the network of meteorological stations of the planet the number one priority of your organization. 
Without reliable data cada_vez_mais, we will continue to speculate, em_vez_de we take the decisions that are necessary, he says. 
Nigerian origin and formation meteorologist, Godwin_O._P._Obasi, was during the last weekend weekend in Lisbon, where he signed a cooperation agreement with the Portuguese government, under which the WMO will fund scholarships for training in Portugal, meteorological technicians African countries where Portuguese is the official language. 
PUBLIC interviewed him. 
PUBLIC - In your opinion, what are the main obstacles aa improvement of weather forecasts? 
A few years ago, missing observation and there was no mathematical models stations or computers capable of modeling the climate and weather conditions. 
Then he started to say was found that the time was a chaotic system and it seemed that the limits imposed aa forecast were, after all, an intrinsic limit of the system itself. 
It considers that the main problems consist of the lack of baseline data, better mathematical models, better computers, or in a impassable due to the difficulty chaos? 
GODWIN_OBASI _-_ First, let me tell HIM that weather forecasts of short and medium term (respectively 1-3 days and 4-10 days) have greatly improved their quality in recent years. 
The lack of data collection stations is the one that seems most important to overcome, to allow to improve the reliability of forecasts. 
As for the models used today, they are very strict and do not seem responsible for the inaccuracy of the forecasts: 
It is the quality of the data that are provided to the computer that condition. 
in a 24-hour forecast for a country of Western Europe, por_exemplo, you need data from all over Europe, a large part of Africa, etc. 
If you want a forecast four days, since it is necessary to cover cerca_de half of the globe. 
And to a forecast além_dos the four or five days, it takes data from around the globe. 
Even if it has an optimal density of observation stations in Portugal, we can not expect a good forecast, nem_sequer to Portugal, the rest of the world are not well covered. 
There are over ten thousand ground stations of observation in the world and more than 1500 weather stations. 
The problem is that for some countries operate these stations is a heavy cost, and many of them reduced observation activities. 
Q. - We are still far away, so to achieve the theoretical limits of the weather forecast? 
A. - The theoretical limits lie If somewhere between 18 and 21 days. 
You can make visions for three, four, ten days and proceed to the 18 with some success, although they will degrade. 
But after the 18 days are not the best of what you try to guess. 
P. local information - As expects to fund all these observation stations it is necessary to mount or reactivate, including the Terceiro_Mundo? 
R. - We try to encourage all member countries of WMO to implement what we believe is necessary to improve the quality of the weather. 
But there are those who have not, in fact, the resources to do so. 
WMO instituted thus a Programa_Voluntário_de_Cooperação, under which certain nations provide equipment, train people from other countries or send experts to do their training. 
One of the reasons for my coming to Portugal was precisely the signing of a Portugal-WMO cooperation agreement, under which they will be granted scholarships for technical training for African Portuguese-speaking countries. 
P. - The lack of weather information relating to certain regions of the world means that they have quality forecasts lower aa other countries? 
R. - Not necessarily. 
in the short-term forecast that may be true, because there is little local information. 
But in what concerns the medium term, these gaps affect everybody, all the predictions that are done in the world. 
Mesmo_que, absurdly, a very rich country rode a weather station every ten kilometers, all that could be improve your short-term forecast. 
in the best of hypotheses, could predict in detail what would happen in the next six to 12 hours, but it would not improve anything in your forecast mais_longo_prazo. 
Not even to do for the next day. 
P. - Improving global weather coverage is the main objective of the WMO? 
R. - It is the main objective of the WMO and is the most sensible thing to do if we want to understand the phenomenon of global warming and its implications. 
Only the improvement of our weather coverage will allow us to know what is actually happening. 
When we think that some models tell us that global warming will cause the level of the sea to rise between 25 centimeters and one meter by the middle of the next century, realize up well the need to improve our ability to control. 
If we invest $ 100 million in the network of observation, we think that uncertainty may be very small, and we will be sure of not being neither overestimate nor underestimate the changes. 
Consensus exists Q. - When you say that the mathematical models used in the forecast are good and what is needed to improve predictions are more data, this means that research has become secondary? 
That there are no longer major problems in terms of models and forecasting techniques? 
R. - Research must always continue. 
I give him a sample of the kind of difficulties we have: 
to make a prediction we need from a given moment, which is considered as the starting point, T zero. 
Which means are necessary simultaneous measurements to know o_que goes around the globe at this very moment. 
But you never get this information at the same time: 
one was taken before, after another, satellites require hours to cover the whole earth. 
You never know what clouds were in the sky at a given time. 
Por_exemplo, the operation is to take on the data collected over a period of time and try to find out what was happening at the time T zero - that assimilation flame - still needs to be greatly improved. 
And this, just to make the initial conditions. 
Then we need to get describe more accurately the clouds that exist, the type of surface, the topography, and to study in depth the nature of the influence of each of these factors in the forecast. 
in this moment, the lack of processing power of computers is not a limitation as it was a few years ago, but when we improve the resolution of our network stations maybe the problem come again to pose. 
P. - Apesar_da the existence of an agreement in the scientific community quanto_ao global warming, United_States continue to say that there is no consensus on the issue and use this fact to refuse to impose restrictions aa carbon dioxide production (CO2). 
Por_que not try WMO validate existing data on global warming and establish a global consensus on aa question? 
R. - OMM 60 has cerca_de stations in the world to measure the concentration of CO2. 
And they all agree that this concentration has increased exponentially. 
The same is true for the nitrogen oxides, methane, chlorofluorocarbons, for all called greenhouse gases. 
We know that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is now 25 percent higher than 1980 pa. 
We do not see, but it's there. 
Which means that the chemistry of the atmosphere changed. 
None of this is imagination or speculation. 
The data are there. 
Towel soaked P. - But it remains a controversy ... 
R. - is controversial because there are scientists who say that given the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we should be seeing an increase of one to two degrees in average temperature. 
But the data only indicate an increase of 0.3 to 0.5 degrees, o_que is dentro_das normal climate fluctuations. 
Probably they are the oceans are absorbing this increase in temperature, but the ocean can reach its limit at any time - like a towel soaked no longer absorb water - and fail to absorb the excessive heat. 
Proof that there is a global consensus on the seriousness of the issue is that there is a Comissão_Intergovernamental_de_Negociação that is discussed -la, and trying to draw up a protocol to reduce emissions of these gases. 
United_States themselves actively participate in these meetings. 
Everyone knows that things can no longer be business as usual and that we need to do something before it's too late. 
Q. - So far, everything that man has done em_relação_ao climate and weather conditions are forecast. 
Do you think one day you can change the desirable form of climate change or the weather? 
R. - Even if it were possible to change the climate in a beneficial way for a region of the world, it would be counterproductive for another. 
Me seems more sensible not try to intervene, except in the respect aa reduction aggression, such as the emission of greenhouse gases. nan nan With the presence of 54 parliamentarians to the 10:40, the plenÃ¡rio of the CÃ ¢ mara comeÃ§ou the debate on the £ prorrogaÃ§Ã the CPMF minutes (of the check tax) © 2011.

The expectation of leaders from the House and the Conselho_de_Ética is that little mais_de 10% of the 69 deputies reported in the interim report of the CPI of the Leeches relinquish their mandates. 
Member of the dome of the House that in the last days, talked with at least 30 parliamentarians accused in the estimated case that seven may waive - Nilton_Capixaba (PTB-RO), Marcelino_Fraga (PMDB-ES), César_Bandeira (PFL-MA) , Benedito_Dias (PP-PA) Carlos_Nader (PL-RJ), João_Caldas (AL-PL) and Reginaldo_Germano (PP-BA). 
Former leader of the PP, Pedro_Henry (MT) wondered out of the function, but would have given up on the idea. 
Until yesterday, only Coriolano_Sales (PFL-BA) had submitted resignation. 
He did not want to risk the chance to take the city of Vitória_da_Conquista. 
Second in 2004 Sales sued his opponent for abuse of economic power and is awaiting results. 
You can not assess how many will resign, said yesterday the president of the Conselho_de_Ética, Ricardo_Izar (PTB-SP). 
It will commence proceedings against the members involved with the mafia of the leeches tomorrow at 10:30. 
Formalized before the opening, the resignation ends the procedure. 
Izar want the cases of 15 parliamentarians who received deposit to their own bank or the relatives are the first judged by the Council. 
I will put in place all the processes together, but the idea is that the 15 most serious cases, which have overwhelming evidence, to be tried in the front, Izhar said. 
The time limit for the parliamentary resigns - 20 hours - was established by the direction of the camera so that the act is formalized with the publication already in the Diário_Oficial of Congress tomorrow. 
Most of the 69 deputies accused of involvement with the mafia of the leeches is aa candidate re-election and, with resignation, will try to escape from the risk of cancellation and the loss of political rights for eight years. 
Other lawmakers resist aa resignation consider having chance to be free from punishment. 
According to investigations initiated by the Polícia_Federal, the scheme consisted of embezzlement of public funds through the submission of parliamentary amendments to the purchase of overpriced ambulances. 
Two of the 69 deputies accused are the Mesa_Diretora, but turned away from the functions. 
Contra_João_Caldas, por_exemplo weigh 12 payments in the amount of R $ 136,000, some of which on its own. 
But he resists aa idea of ​​giving up the mandate. 
Já_Capixaba, accused of having received R $ 646 thousand, seriously consider the possibility of resigning. 
in the case of the members of the Igreja_Universal, the ability to output the position is away, for those involved, including Edna_Macedo (PTB-SP), were banned by the direction of the institution to compete aa reelection. 
Elected in the wake of the deputy Enéas_Carneiro (Prone-SP), former members of the party suspects as Irapuan_Teixeira (PTB-PR) and Ildeu_Araújo (PP-SP), had negligible vote in 2002 and have no chance of re-election. 
They should prefer to keep the rest of the mandate. nan nan If the election were today, President Luiz_Inácio_Lula_da_Silva, candidate aa re-election, would have 44% of the voting intentions, against 25% of the Geraldo_Alckmin toucan, according to the CNI / Ibope released on Friday.
Heloísa_Helena, candidate aa Presidency for the PSOL, was in third, with 11% of the voting intentions, followed by Cristovam_Buarque (PDT) and Luciano_Bivar (PSL), both with 1%. 
José_Maria_Eymael of the CSDP, and Rui_Pimenta of the PCO, did not come to get 1% of the voting intentions. 
Considering only the valid votes, Lula would win the October elections later in the first round. 
You can not make a comparison between the survey released today and the previous one, because this is the first CNI / Ibope with the official list of candidates from the TSE (Tribunal_Superior_Eleitoral) aa presidential succession. 
Today's survey showed a variation in spontaneous list (when respondents say in who intend to vote without a card with names). 
in this scenario, Lula rises from 27% to 31% and Alckmin passes of 4% to 14%; 
Heloise is also growing from 1% to 6%. 
De_acordo to the CNI / Ibope, in a possible second round, Lula lose 10 points clear Alckmin. 
In June, the president had 53% of the voting intentions against 29% of the toucan. 
Now, Lula had 50%, against 36% for Alckmin. 
in an eventual second round with Heloísa_Helena, Lula's advantage would also fall, de_acordo with today's search. 
The president would have 53% of the voting intentions against 30% of Heloise. 
In June, Lula had 57% and 21% Heloise. 
The survey polled 2,002 people between 29 and 31 July in 142 municipalities of the country. 
The margin of error is two percentage points, more or less. 
in comparison with the Ibope poll published nine days ago, Lula remained stable at 44% and Alckmin wavered two percentage points, from 27% to 25%. 
Already Heloise rose three points, from 8% to 11%. 
in a possible second shift and the comparison with search Ibope day 25, Lula ranges from 48% to 50%, while Alckmin falls from 39% to 36%. 
A possible dispute between Lula and Heloise in a second round was not contemplated by the Ibope in this survey of the 25th. 
The numbers from the last survey Datafolha are similar to those disclosed in this Friday. 
in the survey, released in the last 19 by Folha, Lula appears with 44% of intentions to vote and Alckmin with 28%. 
The candidate of the PSOL aa Presidency comes in third with 10%. nan nan was a special and unforgettable Sunday for Brazilian sport.
Amid the Pan - American of the Rio_de_Janeiro, the country stopped to follow two important decisions, but unrelated to the Games. 
The volleyball and football teams won the Liga_Mundial and Copa_América mais_uma_vez and wrote the name of Brazil in their sports. 
The yellow-green Sunday began with the conquest of the heptacampeonato of the League. 
It is true that the selection of Rezende gave a scare into the crowd after losing the first set 25-18. 
But from the second, everything went back to normal. 
With partial 25/23, 28/26 and 25/22 the Brazil razed the Russian selection and kept the hegemony in the world volleyball. 
It was the fifth title followed by the team in the competition. 
Mission accomplished in Poland, the squad now returns his attention to the Pan, only title missing aa team Rezende. 
The premiere of the Brazilians, rumo_à the gold medal, takes place in the next 23 July, 22h against Canada in the renewed Ginásio_do_Maracanãzinho. 
Shortly after, in the beginning of the night, it was time for the football team washer once the soul of the Brazilians. 
With an impeccable performance, Dunga's team thrashed Argentina by 3-0 and made the hermanos amargarem the third runner-up followed, front aa five-times champions selection. 
It is true that Brazil was lucky to get a goal as early as the start of the match. 
Still four minutes Júlio_Baptista dominated dentro_da area, dribbled Ayala and scored, scoring a great goal. 
Applied tactically, with a strong mark in the middle and in the defense and a touch of the ball fast and accurate in the attack, Brazil reached the second goal still in the first half, with a helping hand? or better, a little foot - Ayala, who scored from a cross from Maicon, the 39.
the 23 of the second stage, the fatal blow. 
Vágner_Love pulled a counterattack and touched the measure, in the back of the defense to Daniel_Alves who scored placed without chances to Abbondanzieri. 
The Argentines, with a team full of superstars, and favorites for the title with a faultless campaign so far, did not seem to believe what they saw. 
It is the third end then they lose to the selection. 
In 2004, also by the Copa_América, Argentines were winning by 2-1 when Tevez decided? To be funny? perto_da the flag of corner.
in the next attack, Adriano, who finished the competition as top scorer with seven goals, equalized and took the decision to penalties. 
in the end, Brazilian victory. 
Another setback occurred in 2005 in the finals of the Confederations in Germany. 
Impeccable, the national team, led by Ronaldinho_Gaúcho and Kaka applied a humiliating rout by 4-1 and brought the cup. 
of that time, nor was it required the presence of the stars of Barcelona and Milan. 
it seems, against Argentina, a 'B team? is more than what enough.

Â ?? Politics In my life, boo and applause £ sÃ the two moments of £ reaÃ§Ã the human being. 
The only thing that I particularly feel sad Ã © I was prepared for a party.

I'm sure that does the £ Ã © that the thought of the Rio_de_Janeiro Â ?? Lula said in the radio program Café © with the President.
Â ?? Once finished the event, vÃ¡rias people came to say that it had been arranged that we had received the invitation. 
To me, I do the £ care what happened, already happened. 
The important Ã © it was a extraordinÃ¡ria opening the Jogos_Pan-Americans. THE?? . nan nan TOMORROW, in Paris, when Pedro_Delgado is proclaimed the winner of the Tour aa France, the festive ringing of the bells will deafen Segovia, their homeland.
So he desired a Spanish archbishop on Thursday night pa ... 
leaving God care to recognize their enormous in the imbroglio in which the Tour had sunk two days earlier. 
Thursday, the mais_longo day, stuffed with the wildest rumors and conflicting information about the case Delgado, that only the official statement of the president of the jury commissioners, Mário_Precce, put an end cerca_das the 21 hours. 
The second analysis of urines of Pedro_Delgado held on the same morning, positive new fora_de - but as it verified the presence of probenicid, a product that does not appear in the list of banned substances by the União_Ciclista_Internacional, can not be subject to sanctions for Pedro_Delgado corridor. 
In Spain, television and radio interrupted its programs to the sound of the Aleluia_de_Haendel, giving the news. 
in the bars of Segovia, champagne - only Spanish - ran in streams and the party lasted until the wee hours -If in the hot spanish night. 
But to the people gathered in Clermont-Ferrand - where you installed the caravan of the Tour after the day stage - began a series of questions, the more that the jury should also speak about -If Theunisse case. 
The Dutch runner, who occupied the 5th place in the overall standings, was penalized by ten minutes and went to 11th place by the second analysis of urine samples confirmed the presence of Codeine - a substance used in numerous products against flu and cough - but prohibited by the anti-doping regulations of the União_Ciclista_Internacional (UCI). 
So why not Theunisse and Delgado? 
- asked some journalists, stressing that the probenicid should be included in the list of banned products of the UCI in early August. 
This drug-free sale in pharmacies, is usually used with anti - inflammatory in cases of gout, but also has the property of disguise in urine assays, anabolic waste - products made of hormones synthetic male that increase the development of muscle mass. 
But in the Hotel_Terminus_de_Clermont-Ferrand, where he was installed the Reynolds team, the time was pure joy: 
informed that washed out officially of all suspected, Pedro_Delgado - who denied ever having resorted to doping - confessed his relief: 
I want to forget all of this case. 
I'm the only yellow jersey of the Tour, everything else no longer has the slightest importance. 
Delgado learned of the positive results in the first analysis of urine (held on the Friday of the last week) to the most brutal form: 
his teammate heard it on television, in the Tuesday night aa where the news had the effect of a bomb. 
in a moralizing tone and accuser, Jacques_Chancel - one of the last dinosaurs of the French journalism's old guard - revealed a few minutes before the newscast of the eight, the yellow jersey had used doping. 
Chancel been awakened in the middle of the night by a mysterious phone call from someone who did not want to see the Tour de France stained with the disqualification of the Spanish hall only after he had been anointed champion, if the result of the analysis only came to be disclosed later. 
But the next day, Chancel left the patronizing tone of the day before and interspersed their noisy demonstrations of solidarity with Pedro_Delgado with multiple details of migraine horrible that the whole affair had provoked him. 
All this because, however, the reactions of the second scoop channel had been globally negative. 
First, in France, where a handful of journalists was aware of the case but decided to observe the ethical rules of the profession and not reveal it as he was not officially confirmed by a second analysis. 
Then in Spain - where the population cholera accused the French to want to steal -In the yellow jersey numerous reports made by television and the French radio revealed that the Spaniards did not believe one minute it was, on the charges against Delgado, and strongly suspected of the unwillingness of the French: 
They are even weird, said the owner of a bar of Segovia, very sure of their claims. 
French tourists are the only ones to leave the car in any way, in the square of the church, where parking is prohibited. 
The Madrid daily sports so entitled Brand your comment: 
France: 
intrigue against danger, and condemned the sad behavior of the French. 
The very serious El_País wrote in turn: 
The regulation prohibits the publication the result of a doping control to aa performing a second analysis. 
In France, the public of the Tour, which has a real sympathy for the Spanish champion, continued to witness HIM your confidence, and not a single assobiu esfuziou on the shoulders of the roads or lines of arrival. 
in the squad, only the French runner Eric_Boyer condemned Pedro_Delgado, but the Dutch Steven_Rooks - second in the general classification - promised that if the yellow jersey was handed over on Sunday in the wake of a possible penalty Pedro_Delgado he would with all his Dutch team PDM take her on the following day, Segovia, for him to deliver. 
This feeling of solidarity was summarized to express by the Portuguese runner Acácio_da_Silva, contacted on Wednesday in Limoges: 
The Pedro_Delgado is a great champion and he knows, like everyone, that the yellow jersey is systematically controlled at each step. 
I do not believe, like many people, he has resorted to doping. 
The own French press, espectaculando about the identity of the mysterious informant Chancel, spared no praise ombridade aa, aa dignity and the character qualities of the Spanish champion, almost as if to make us forget the way the case had been revealed. 
But the immediate coming to Paris to the Spanish Secretary of State for Sport - accompanied by the director of the Laboratory anti-doping Spanish Conselho_Superior_dos_Desportos - to attend in person at the Thursday, aa second analysis of the urine of Pedro_Delgado, fed numerous rumors about possible pressure from state to Delgado was washed suspicion. 
And a Spanish radio cast, a_meio of the afternoon, fuel to the fire saying that the result of the second analysis was negative. 
the end of the afternoon, in the however, knew was found that the Laboratório_Lafarge, only authorized to carry out medical analyzes of the Tour, would have found waste probenicid and would have rated positive Delgado analysis because he had only a list of the products banned by the Comité_Olímpico_Internacional - na_qual the probenicid is included - but that would not have the list of products banned by the União_Ciclista_Internacional where the drug is not included. 
Some doctors of the tour, when they heard the explanations of the second channel stating that anabolic (chemically disguised by the probenicid) were not used in cycling because it had no effect on the physical strength of the corridors, laughed ironically and a they recalled a phrase famous of Eddy_Merckx: 
You can not win a Tour aa France only eat sandwiches of cheese. 
And Friday, the French press denounced the hypocrisy of all the Delgado case. 
Recalling the unfortunate way been revealed and the proportions it has reached, only fed by rumors, some editorial writers were, however, further in its analysis, wondering how a runner like Delgado would need a product against gout and showing - are skeptical quanto_às the explanation of the problem of excess uric acid in the blood. 
And said although it is common practice to many cyclists take steroids during the winter and stop just before an important event, adding that it is also common they take, por_vezes, products such as probenicid afraid still persist in the detectable residues body of this anabolic . 
The direction of the tour without getting into the controversy, issued a statement regretting the slowness of the process and attitude, by the menos_ambígua, the sports authorities and expresses its astonishment that the fact that two analyzes of the same nature have given conclusions contradictory. 
But in Segovia, these rumors have not even been heard:

The unification was proposed on Tuesday by the bench of the PT in the Senate. 
. 
in the opinion of Quintanilha, a single investigation into several complaints does not allow different conclusíμes on the alleged involvement of Renan in actions that may constitute a breach of parliamentary decorum. 
I defend the thesis that each performance must have different treatment. 
Let's unify if I am outvoted he said. 
Quintanilha said it will maintain consistency in their decision, since denied request for PSOL to include the new allegations against Renan in the first case against the PMDB which entered into the agenda of the plenary session of the Senate in the last week. 
I'll keep the consistency of my decision. 
I think it will confuse the charges if everything is analyzed together. 
I advocate the cause of the different treatment to each representation. 
. 
The unification of the processes is supported by the bench of the PT in the Senate and the PSOL party, which joined with three of the four representations against Renan. 
Senator José_Nery (PSOL-PA) only questioned the fact the unification being discussed at this time, since a few months ago Conselho_de_Ética denied the request of the legend to gather complaints against Renan in one piece. 
We tried to make an addition, the board replied that it would be not possible. 
Our understanding is that all representations deal with possible decorum break. 
This set of reports could be aggregated into a single process. 
It was sliced ​​into this pile of processes because the board wanted it criticized Nery. 
Quintanilha said that even if the unification of the process is approved by the board, will defend different rapporteurs for each of the accusations against Renan. 
But he acknowledged that hardly rapporteurs have similar positions on the representations. 
Who can guarantee that will work at the same time with similar schedule? 
And if one has an understanding of the complaints and the others do not agree? 
This complicates the work, he said. 
in the opinion of the senator Aloizio_Mercadante (PT-SP), the plenary of the House should not analyze separately the three representations against Renan that pass in the Senate. 
We must analyze the three representations missing, provide a full report of the three so that each definitely form their judgment of merit, he defended. 
The Conselho_de_Ética will decide on the unification of the cases against Renan at a meeting scheduled for next Wednesday. 
on the same day, the board will discuss the report of Senator João_Pedro (PT-AM) on the second case against --no PMDB which is accused of using his political influence to benefit the company Schincariol. 
The council decided to leave the meeting for next week as tomorrow, the Mesa_Diretora the Senate will decide whether to forward the fourth complaint against Renan to the Board of Ethics of the House. 
Quintanilha thought it best to wait for the decision of the Bureau before discussing the unification of processes, since the fourth representation may meet the other two against the PMDB if all processes are subject to be processed together in the Council of Ethics. nan nan Minister of the Egyptian Health Hatem_El-Gabaly, reported on Monday that 57 people died and 128 were injured in the collision between two passenger trains in the delta of the Nile, north of Cairo.

Abbey prison is part of the Operação_Farrapos started in this morning by the Polícia_Federal. 
Abbey is appointed by the US government as a AmericaDo of the largest cocaine traffickers in Colombia and was involved with trafficking since 1986. 
Abbey goes to Superintendência_da_Polícia_Federal_na_Lapa, Zona_Oeste of the Capital. 
The US agency to combat trafficking, DEA (US 
Drug_Enforcement_Administration) offered US $ 5 million (almost US $ 10 million) for those who provide information on the whereabouts Abbey - with the caveat that the money was guaranteed by the US government. 
The PF could not say if this kind of reward is paid to law enforcement agencies. 
De_acordo with information from the agency, Abadia was arrested in March 1996 by sending the United_States 30 tons of cocaine and sending drugs to the country in association with a cartel of Tijuana in Mexico.

The bicycle, as a Christmas gift, birthday or school performance, keeps a record of popularity that even computers can beat. 
Still widely used as a means of transport, the bicycle has up very popular during the English industrial revolution of the end of the last century, scoring a number of generations and evolved a lot since then. 
So that, in Belgium, the municipal officials are concerned to build along the road a short walk reserved to the bicycle drivers also signaled with their own treadmills at the intersection with other roads. 
And it is not sporadic cases prior to the contrary. 
Por_exemplo is not a strange situation in the Netherlands see spending a doctor visiting a patient doing ... If carrying a bike! 
It is therefore of cycling that you want to talk about today, but about the touring or sports bike rides. 
Like other activities that have already mentioned, this also has a strong leisure component, maintenance, health and physical condition, which contrasts with the victory of objectives and high competition found in cycling, in which the Portuguese have such great traditions. 
And para_além_dos the direct benefits that can be drawn from their practice, also contributes treated to a better environment and conservation of nature. 
The regularity and proper dosage of the touring have aa similarity jogging and maintenance implications circuits required to organic, muscle and mental level as well as other advantages. 
The balance being absolutely necessary for cycling, this is a great way for the development and a_partir_do the moment it is purchased, have hardly lost. 
This activity is also suitable for people with mild joint problems in the legs or in the degree of obesity and consequent weight, is likely to damage the joints of the ankle to the knee or even the hip. 
Given that there are no constant clashes with the ground, as in the most vulgarized sporting activities, the risk of problems in these regions is thus reduced. 
And for those who like to travel great distances in a short time, with the landscape to change itself to every moment, while eao take care of your physical condition, cycle tourism is therefore an ideal activity. 
As for the care and the além_dos herein on 12.03.1988, to be observed, the regular practice of cycling should be preceded by a visit to the doctor, which is all the more required as there are problems, or it is suspected : 
- the labyrinthine (inner ear) system, with direct implications in the balance; 
- in the joints of the lower limbs, particularly evolutionary arthrosis; 
- anal or perianal region and infectious nature. 
We went back to remember the importance of heating, which should be especially located in the lower limbs, taking into account the joints. 
And choose route plans, the least initially, in wooded areas and aprasíveis, avoiding busy roads whenever possible or hours of heavy traffic. 
Here too it is important the principle of a shorter duration and higher frequency of the activity, rather than too long a few times. 
If advises three or four half-hour sessions per week, which may have initially 15 minutes for those in poor physical condition, and go after increasing gradually its intensity and duration, as well as the requirements of the route. 
And do not inhibit from before a slope, down from the bike and climbed -la aa hand, o_que allows you to a healthy and profitable recovery. 
Clothing - You do not need special equipment for touring: 
shorts or pants tracksuit and a T-shirt and / or sweater in cotton, which can be wool when the weather is cool or rainy. 
If you rather cold or wind, it is advisable to place a protective fabric in the chest and in the back. 
And protect your head from the sun or the cold, where necessary, with a cap well adjusted ... not to fly. 
If roll in dark night time or aa view light clothing and, if possible, adjust HIM reflective material: 
If it is important to be seen. 
in the case of its activity is very regular and continuous, we recommend the use of cycling shorts, for protecting the skin and genital areas. 
Also convenient is the use of cycling jerseys because they are long, HIM protecting the kidneys, and have pockets where you can take any material or food reinforcements. 
The bicycle - There is aa his willingness to market a wide range of models and types of bikes. 
Almost all they are good for the practice of cycling, although the ride, particularly equipped with speed changes, are preferable to the cycle-cross or bi-cross, apesar_de not need a sophisticated model for this activity. 
A classic or modern bike has a common set of components, whose names will acquainted, but for cycling are recommended over some equipment: 
- to support the water tank; 
- Additional substrates for material transport (low); 
- Side and rear reflectors; 
- generator with front light (for illumination) and rear (presence). 
The conversion of mechanical energy rotates the bicycle o_que is achieved through the pedals. 
The movement is obtained also depends on the gear ratio, i.e. the ratio between the number of teeth of the chainring (A) and the freewheel (B) whose rotation is transmitted by the chain (C) (see figure). 
of where gear changes alter this relationship according to the needs of the rider, making HIM driving. 
There are also other factors that may aid in the performance and well - being during cycling activity, such as: 
- the height of the seat, which is seated right to itself, with the foot in the foot nearest the ground and so that the leg is in full extension; 
- the height of the picture, which should have 2/3 of its height between legs; 
- forward / back of the saddle, so you need to sit themselves in the saddle, with the hands on the handlebars and put your feet on the pedals, with both aa same distance from the ground: 
the correct position will therefore be one that allows a perpendicular to the ground and passes through the knee aa 1 cm forward of the center axis of the pedal. 
Além_do the fulfillment of the signs and traffic rules, the cicloturista must also: 
- if you do not know well the bike, which confirm the corresponding brake wheel aa adn the front of the rear, as well as their status; 
- always circulate through the right and never pairs but queued; 
- take into account the displacement of air that lorries cause; 
- be aware of the conditions of the floor, especially if it is slippery and sandy in the curves, adn their condition (holes, stones, etc). 
And at night, with dark weather or poor visibility: 
- wear light clothing with reflective strips and / or flourishing; 
- always have reflector side and the rear of the bike; 
- have lighting for the front and light incarnate presence behind; 
- acquiring, if possible, a flag to unit cells, which can be set aa left leg or arm and emits white light and red forward to rear (see figure).

in it, Schopenhauer analyzes the main argumentative deceptive schemes that bad philosophers use, with reasonable success, to persuade the public that 2 + 2 = 5, basing herself, especially in the Tópicos_de_Aristóteles. 
Mention was found that, by eristic dialectic, a term that is the subtitle of the book, Schopenhauer understands the art of arguing, more precisely the art of arguing to win, and that per fas et per nefas (by fair means or foul) . 
in the work, Schopenhauer distinguishes the following dialectical stratagems:. 
Take the claim to the opponent além_de its natural limit, interpret her from the most general way possible, take -la in the broadest possible sense and exaggerate -la; 
conversely, focus own statement in the most limited sense, in the narrowest possible limits; 
therefore quanto_mais generic becomes a statement, the more attacks it is exposed. 
The antidote is the exact placement of the puncti (Latin; 
points, termination, end) or status controversiae (Latin; 
controversy in the case, pointing out the controversy, contradiction.) Example: 
Using homonyms to make extensive statement presented to it also that, apart from the identity name, pouco_ou has nothing in common with the thing that it is; 
then refute emphasizing this statement and give the impression of having refuted the first. 
Example:. 
The statement that was presented in relative mode ... is taken as if it had been presented in absolutely, universally ... or less is understood in a completely different direction, and thus refuted on the basis of this second context. 
This makes the opponent, in reality, speaking a different thing from the one that had put. 
When we let ourselves go through this? ? Ploy? ? , Commit, then a? ? Ignoratio elenchi? ?
(Ignorance of the counter-argument). 
. 
Example: 
The advocates Decrim abortion. 
B argues that to decriminalize abortion murder of any kind will be decriminalized. 
When you want to make a deduction, you should not let it be envisioned, but em_vez_disso this, cause the opponent to admit without realizing the premises at a time (...) to the contrary, it will try every kind of cleverness ( ...) 
-If must present the premises of these assumptions and pre-syllogisms do; 
make the premises of several of these pre-syllogisms are aceitas_de_modo cluttered and confusing, hiding therefore the game itself until all that is needed is admitted. .
Schopenhauer suggests that this ploy does not require exemplification. 
Can herself, to prove the propositions themselves, before making use of false propositions, if the opponent does not want to accept the true, either because they realize that the thesis will be deducted as an immediate consequence. 
So we adopt propositions that are false in themselves but true? ? Ad hominem? ? And we argue? ? Ex newly - arrived The Hunter and Rainha_do_Gelo and holdover Batman vs Superman:
